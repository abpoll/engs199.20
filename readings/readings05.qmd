## Required Reading

1. @KwakkelHaasnoot2019
    - This is a relatively short read and is good for thinking about the overall picture. 
2. @BartholomewKwakkel2020
    - This is the paper we're going to review for our case study on Wednesday. I'll lead this one. 

## Optional Reading

There are a few approaches since the DMDU taxonomy chapter that I think are worth knowing about and considering as potentially relevant for your study.
