# Overview of today's "lab"

## Goals
* Scrutinize different trade-off visualization techniques and implementation
* Critique general visualization implementation
* Propose good practices you will follow when making visualizations

## Instructions

* Review each example for 1 minute and rate the figure from 1-5, with 5 being the best
* After time is up, write down your rating in the Zoom chat
* The raters who give the lowest and highest ratings will explain their ratings
* As a group, discuss what the (potentially) pessimistic/optimistic raters are missing

# Synthesizing our reactions

## What worked and what didn't?
* Are there specific visual languages you prefer? 
* Do you think there are objective criteria for saying whether a trade-off plot is effective?
* Do you think there are objective criteria for saying whether a visualization is effective?
* What are your takeaways for your decision analysis project?  
* What will be your visualization check list? 

# Upcoming calendar
## Next week
* Monday: bringing things together with MORDM (guest lecture)
* Wednesday: case study
* Friday: case study and hw 4 due (Sunday ok)
