        "Today we're going to install (or double check installations for) the computing tools we will use in this course and practice the lab report submission workflow. If you are an experienced programmer, you are free to follow your own workflow and/or use your own toolkit for implementing labs - but there is a lower probability that I can help you troubleshoot any issues you run into. Today's lab is not graded. \n",
        "\n",
        "Today we will:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [git](https://git-scm.com/). \n",
        "2. Setup our [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and create a repository for today's lab.\n",
        "3. Run through the setup steps typical of future labs, run some code, export our notebook, and submit a pdf on Canvas. \n",

        "\n",
        "1. Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your machine if you don't already have it. \n",
        "2. Install [Mamba](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#install) for your system if you don't already have it. We will use Python in individual `Mamba` environments as opposed to a system-wide distribution. \n",
        "    - Please review [key concepts](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/concepts.html#concepts) for environment management with `Mamba`.\n",
        "3. Install the Jupyter & Python VS Code extensions, along with their extension packs. \n",
        "4. Download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your machine if you don't already have it. \n",
        "5. Setup a [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account) account if you don't already have one. I *highly* recommend following the instructions for [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). \n",
        "6. [Create a new Public repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) called 'ENGS 199.20 Lab 1'. Add a `README`, `.gitignore`, and License. Learn about these files if you are unfamiliar with them.\n",
        "7. [Clone your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your local machine. I recommend having a directory for this class and to clone the repository inside that directory. \n",
        "8. Download this file as a Jupyter notebook (see the upper righthand corner of the page) and add it to your project directory. You can use whatever git workflow you'd like to do version control, but I will provide instructions for using the command line. \n",
        "    - Run `git remote -v` to check that your local repository is tracking the repository on GitHub. \n",
        "    - Run `git status` from this lab directory's root to see that the notebook is untracked.\n",
        "    - Run `git add .` to track the notebook. \n",
        "    - Run `git commit -m [message]` with your own helpful message.\n",
        "    - Use this simple workflow when you make changes to files. If you don't want to track a file, you can add the specific file's location (or use wildcards and file prefixes or suffixes) to avoid tracking.\n",
        "9. For this lab, we are going to create a small environment that allows us to plot using the `seaborn` package. `conda-lock` allows us to create multi-platform instances of the exact package versions others need to reproduce our computational environment. After following these next instructions, we will be ready to run our notebook. \n",

To better understand these associations, it would be helpful to show histograms in a second panel under the present plot. In addition, it's not clear why presence of smokers in a dining party would have any association with the bill size. Other variables in the dataset, such as time of day and size of the party are likely more relevant to consider. \n",
