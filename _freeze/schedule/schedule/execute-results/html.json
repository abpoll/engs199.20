You can also access each week's lab through the links in the schedule below. \n\n- [**HW**](project/updates.qmd) {{< fa sharp pen-field >}}: This page contains the schedule and rubric for the course project. At the end of each module, you will have one week to submit your responses to guided questions on how you will integrate new concepts into your final project. I **highly** encourage you to work on these during the module to stay on track with your project. **Note that there is no lab report the first week and the first assignment is to define your project's decision problem.**\n\n- **Reading** {{< fa sharp book-open >}}: On the schedule, this link takes you to a list of required and optional readings for the module. Please read the required reading before class. There will typically be one required reading per week. I suggest you read at least the abstracts of optional readings before class. The optional readings will help you understand lecture and can serve as core references in lab reports and project updates.\n\n:::::: {.row .d-flex .justify-content-center}\n::::: {.col-12 .col-sm-10 .col-md-6}\n:::: {.card .bg-info .text-white}\n::: {.card-body}\n\n**You should follow this general process for each module**\n\n- Do the Reading before Monday's Lecture\n- Complete the lab report within one week from the assignment date\n- Submit the homework within one week from the assignment date\n\n:::\n::::\n:::::\n::::::\n\n<br />\nThere are seven modules in this course:\n\n* \"Overview\": Overview of decision analysis for wicked climate problems\n* \"Uncertainty\": Uncertainty and Monte Carlo analysis\n* \"RDM\": Robust decision-making\n* \"Trade-offs\": Multiple objectives and navigating trade-offs\n* \"DMDU\":  Decision making under deep uncertainty\n* \"Gaps\": Gaps between decision analysis and decision support\n* \"Projects\":  Student project presentations\n\nNote that this schedule will be updated as necessary throughout the term.\n\n| Week | Date | Topic | Slides | Lab | HW | Reading |\n|:----:|:-----|:------|:------:|:---:|:--:|:-------:|\n| | | <span class=\"module-header\">**Overview**</span> | | | | |\n| 1 | 9/15/25 | Course Overview | [{{< fa sharp presentation-screen >}}](../slides/lecture01-intro.qmd) |  |  | [{{< fa sharp book-open >}}](../readings/readings01.qmd) |\n| 1 | 9/16/25 | Computing setup |  | [{{< fa sharp laptop-code >}}](../labs/lab01-intro.qmd) |  |  |\n| 1 | 9/17/25 | Framing a decision analysis | [{{< fa sharp presentation-screen >}}](../slides/lecture02-framing.qmd) |  |  |  |\n| 1 | 9/19/25 | Intro to Python and GitHub |  | [{{< fa sharp laptop-code >}}](../labs/lab01-1-intro.qmd) |  |  |\n| | | <span class=\"module-header\">**Uncertainty**</span> | | | | |\n| 2 | 9/22/25 | Shallow and deep uncertainties |  |  |  |  |\n| 2 | 9/23/25 | Python and GitHub II |  |  |  |  |\n| 2 | 9/24/25 | Deep uncertainty game |  |  |  |  |\n| 2 | 9/26/25 | Pitfalls of predict-then-act |  |  |  |  |\n| | | <span class=\"module-header\">**RDM**</span> | | | | |\n| 3 | 9/29/25 | RDM workflow |  |  |  |  |\n| 3 | 10/1/25 | Journal club |  |  |  |  |\n| 3 | 10/3/25 | Home elevation problem |  |  |  |  |\n| | | <span class=\"module-header\">**Trade-offs**</span> | | | | |\n| 4 | 10/6/25 | DA in a pluralistic society |  |  |  |  |\n| 4 | 10/8/25 | Guest panel |  |  |  |  |\n| 4 | 10/10/25 | Navigating trade-offs |  |  |  |  |\n| 5 | 10/13/25 | Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms |  |  |  |  |\n| 5 | 10/15/25 | Race to the best Pareto front |  |  |  |  |\n| 5 | 10/17/25 | Race to the best Pareto front |  |  |  |  |\n| | | <span class=\"module-header\">**DMDU**</span> | | | | |\n| 6 | 10/20/25 | Direct policy search |  |  |  |  |\n| 6 | 10/22/25 | Reinforcement learning lab |  |  |  |  |\n| 6 | 10/24/25 | Lab continued |  |  |  |  |\n| 7 | 10/27/25 | Robustness |  |  |  |  |\n| 7 | 10/29/25 | Journal club |  |  |  |  |\n| 7 | 10/31/25 | Putting it all together |  |  |  |  |\n| 8 | 11/3/25 | Robustness II |  |  |  |  |\n| 8 | 11/5/25 | Practice presentations |  |  |  |  |\n| 8 | 11/7/25 | Putting it all together II |  |  |  |  |\n| | | <span class=\"module-header\">**Gaps**</span> | | | | |\n| 9 | 11/10/25 | More useful decision analysis |  |  |  |  |\n| 9 | 11/12/25 | Guest panel |  |  |  |  |\n| 9 | 11/14/25 | Presentations |  |  |  |  |\n| | | <span class=\"module-header\">**Projects**</span> | | | | |\n| 10 | 11/17/25 | Presentations |  |  |  |  |\n| 10 | 11/18/25 | Presentations |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n",
