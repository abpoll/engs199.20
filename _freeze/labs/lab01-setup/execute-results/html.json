If you are an experienced programmer, you are free to follow your own workflow and/or use your own toolkit for implementing labs - but there is a lower probability that I can help you troubleshoot any issues you run into. Today's lab is not graded. \n\nToday we will:\n\n1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [git](https://git-scm.com/). \n2. Setup our [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and create a repository for today's lab.\n3. Run through the setup steps typical of future labs, run some code, export our notebook, and submit a pdf on Canvas. \n\n## Lab Workflow\n\n### Installation and Setup\n\n1. Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your machine if you don't already have it. \n2. Install [Mamba](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#install) for your system if you don't already have it. We will use Python in individual `Mamba` environments as opposed to a system-wide distribution. \n    - Please review [key concepts](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/concepts.html#concepts) for environment management with `Mamba`.\n3. Install the Jupyter & Python VS Code extensions, along with their extension packs. \n4. Download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your machine if you don't already have it. \n5. Setup a [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account) account if you don't already have one. I *highly* recommend following the instructions for [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). \n6. [Create a new Public repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) called 'ENGS 199.20 Lab 1'. Add a `README`, `.gitignore`, and License. Learn about these files if you are unfamiliar with them.\n7. [Clone your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your local machine. I recommend having a directory for this class and to clone the repository inside that directory. \n8. Download this file as a Jupyter notebook (see the upper righthand corner of the page) and add it to your project directory. You can use whatever git workflow you'd like to do version control, but I will provide instructions for using the command line. \n    - Run `git remote -v` to check that your local repository is tracking the repository on GitHub. \n    - Run `git status` from this lab directory's root to see that the notebook is untracked.\n    - Run `git add .` to track the notebook. \n    - Run `git commit -m [message]` with your own helpful message.\n    - Use this simple workflow when you make changes to files. If you don't want to track a file, you can add the specific file's location (or use wildcards and file prefixes or suffixes) to avoid tracking.\n9. For this lab, we are going to create a small environment that allows us to plot using the `seaborn` package. `conda-lock` allows us to create multi-platform instances of the exact package versions others need to reproduce our computational environment. After following these next instructions, we will be ready to run our notebook. \n\nCreate a file called `env-lock.yml` in your lab1 directory. Add the following contents and save:\n```yaml\nname: lab1\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\ndependencies:\n  - python\n  - nbconvert\n  - ipykernel\n  - seaborn\n  - jupyter\n  - conda-lock\n```\nRun `mamba create -f env-lock.yml`. \nRun `mamba activate lab1`. \nSet up the kernel for the environment with `python -m ipykernel install --user --name lab1 --display-name lab1`.\n\n### Run Code\n\nBelow, I reproduce a plot from the [seaborn Gallery](seaborn.pydata.org/examples/grouped_boxplot.html). Make sure the `lab1` kernel is set up in the notebook and then run the code block. \n\n::: {#f44c4c7a .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set_theme(style=\"ticks\", palette=\"pastel\")\n\n# Load the example tips dataset\ntips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\n\n# Draw a nested boxplot to show bills by day and time\nsns.boxplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\",\n            hue=\"smoker\", palette=[\"m\", \"g\"],\n            data=tips)\nsns.despine(offset=10, trim=True)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](lab01-setup_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAttractive and clear figures are very important in decision analysis.

Red diamonds denote the mean restaurant bill in each group.](lab01-setup_files/figure-html/revised-plot-output-1.png){#revised-plot}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFollowing the link in the seaborn example, we can learn more about the tips data [here](https://rdrr.io/cran/reshape2/man/tips.html). \n\nTo complete this lab report, add a code cell where you create a new figure that explores the relationship between variables in this dataset. It does not have to use the variables we used so far, nor do you have to use a boxplot. Make sure your tick and axis labels are at least size 12 and that the figure resolution is at least 300 dots per inch. Make sure your figure includes a caption, which must state the association considered in the exploratory visualization. In the cell after your plot, add a markdown cell where you:\n\n1. Write out a caption; \n2. Describe the plotted result; \n3. Suggest further analysis that could help uncover the relationship between these and/or other variables. \n\nSee a text example below for the revised figure from the seaborn example (note the caption underneath the revised figure on the website). \n\nAnalysis: On average, the waiter's bills were similar regardless of day of the week or whether a smoker was present in the party. On Saturdays and Sundays, bills tended to be larger and more variable when smokers are in a party. \n\nFuture work: Lacking information on the relative frequency of bills across days of the week and smokers present in a party, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions about the associations of bill size and the considered variables. To better understand these associations, it would be helpful to show histograms in a second panel under the present plot. In addition, it's not clear why presence of smokers in a dining party would have any association with the bill size. Other variables in the dataset, such as time of day and size of the party are likely more relevant to consider. \n\n**Note**: If you do not have experience with Python, I recommend trying to generate a new plot -- the `seaborn` package does not really require Python knowledge to generate a new plot. However, today's lab is not graded so you don't *have* to generate a new plot, write a caption, etc., I think it's a good opportunity to practice the lab submission workflow and ask questions now before I start grading labs. \n\n### Submit Code and Report\nMake sure your GitHub repository is up to date. \n\nExport your .ipynb as a .pdf and submit on Canvas. In your submission, share a link to your repository. Please replace \"ENGS 199.20\" in the top cell with your name and change the filename to include your name. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Printing Code to PDF\nBecause we included `nbconvert` in our computational environment, we should be able to export the .ipynb to .pdf using VS Code and get a nicely formatted file. \n:::\n\n",
