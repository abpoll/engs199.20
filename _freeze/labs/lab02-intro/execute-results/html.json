There's a lot of content in this lab, so I will host an extra hour session on Tuesday so that I'm available for questions. Today's lab is not graded. \n\nToday's objectives:\n1. Become more comfortable using [numpy] for efficient array-based operations\n2. Become more comfortable using [pandas] for structured data analysis\n3. Create a reproducible analysis with GitHub\n4. Get some practice using Python to address a *toy* decision analysis problem\n\n## Lab Workflow\n\n### Part 1: GitHub Repository Setup\n\n1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository called \"toy-flood-analysis\"\n2. Clone the repo locally (I recommend using ssh as discussed last lab)\n3. Create the folder structure below\ntoy-flood-analysis/\n|----data/\n|----notebooks/\n|----figures/\n|----docs/\n|_README.md\n|_.gitignore\n\n",
