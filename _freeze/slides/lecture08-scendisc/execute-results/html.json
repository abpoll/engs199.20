The goals are:\n\n* High coverage (analagous to recall)\n* High density (analagous to precision)\n* High interpretability (highly subjective!)\n\n## Trade-offs in achieving scenario \"quality\"\nOften, coverage, density, and interpretability compete with one another\n\n::: {#cfc1d574 .cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](lecture08-scendisc_files/figure-revealjs/cell-2-output-1.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Scenario discovery algorithms\n\n::: {.incremental}\n* You often see classification & regression trees (CART) or patient rule induction method (PRIM) - examples to follow\n* But, keep your goal in mind a use your imagination!\n* No matter what you implement, calculate diagnostics!  \n:::\n\n# Scenario discovery examples\n## Patient Rule Induction Method \n\n![](../_assets/img/bryant_prim.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n::: {.fragment}\n![[Bryant and Lempert (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2009.08.002)](../_assets/img/bryant_prim_points.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n## Classification and Regression Trees\n![[Hadka et al., (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2015.07.014)](../_assets/img/hadka_cart.jpg)\n\n## Multi-trait Scenario Storyline Discovery\n![[Hadjimichael et al., (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023EF004252)](../_assets/img/hadjimichael_sd.jpg)\n\n# Broader considerations\n\n## Scenario discovery was conceived as part of a deliberative, iterative process\n\n::: {.incremental}\n* This is one of the best opportunities for learning in the co-production process\n* It's also a great opportunity for producing science insights (even outside of co-production settings!) \n    - Several optional readings demonstrate this by considering a wide range of ensembles beyond the limited SSP-RCP ones\n:::\n\n## Don't let exploratory modeling taking your judgement out of the equation\n\n:::{.columns}\n\n:::{.column #vcenter width=\"40%\"}\n:::{.incremental}\n* Scenario discovery is a process\n* Simple visual analysis can inform algorithmic choices, but can also be effective in-and-of itself\n:::\n:::\n\n:::{.column #vcenter #unpad-fig width=\"60%\"}\n![[Quinn et al., (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.02.017)](../_assets/img/quinn_robust.png){width=500}\n:::\n\n:::\n\n# Logistics\n## This week\n* Optimization tutorial on Wed. by Prabhat\n* Case study on Friday\n\n## Next week\n* Discussion about revisiting decision analysis framing\n* Practice presentations Wed. & Fri.\n\n",
