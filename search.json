    "text": "Optional Reading\nI higly recommend reading Banzhaf (2009). Here is a stable URL to the pdf. Benefit-cost analysis (BCA) is a requirement for many public resource allocation decisions. This history of the intellectual debate and political considerations between two visions for BCA in the U.S. – multi-objective and single-objective analysis – is illuminating. You will learn about theoretical and practical strengths/limitations of each approach and how that relates to different views of the role of the scientist/analyst in conducting a decision analysis to inform decisions. In addition, because BCA is a prevailing paradigm, you should be familiar with its conceptual underpinnings and assumptions.\nI also recommend reading the papers below to get exposure to papers that focus on trade-offs and synergies as key framing points of the decision analysis.\n\nPollack et al.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is your opportunity to get feedback on how you’re structuring your ideas for your final presentation and report. Your presentation and report should tell the same story, but they should be appropriate for the context and audience. Your presentation is 15 minutes, so you need to deliver a tight and clear high-level story about your decision analysis. Your report is a draft of several sections of your next peer-reviewed publication about your decision analysis. You can, and should, extrapolate on context and details in this format but should not depart much from the narrative arc of your presentation. The two are great to work on simultaneously.\nIn this module, the main thing we are learning how to do is tie together the concepts from previous modules into a coherent and appropriate end-to-end analytical framework that address our decision problem. As such, this is the time for you in both presentation and report form to lay out:\n\nWhat is the decision problem?\nWhy is it important?\nHow are decisions made right now?\nWhat is the state-of-the-art in understanding this problem and status quo?\nWhat room is there for progress?\nWhat gap do you address?\n\nHow can you simply characterize your main refinement and contribution?\nOne way to do this convincingly is to frame it as a “status quo + 1” type of story (or something analogous)\nIt can help to focus on one key part of the logic of the overarching DMDU approach (e.g., this study focuses on trade-offs, this study focuses on how accounting for deep uncertainties reveals that currently preferred strategies may have high regret)\n\nHow will you address this in your study?\n\nWhat is “real” and “stylized” in your approach?\nWhat is out of scope?\n\nWhat do you hypothesize you will find?\nWhat are your plans to connect your decision analysis insights to decision-makers?\n\nFor both your presentation and report, imagine a general science audience. This means that you don’t have to completely simplify your language like you might for interviews with journalists, but you should define concepts that are specific to your field and the kind of decision analysis we learned in this course. For example, if you refer to parameters in your model without clarification (e.g., with a schematic representation of your model and avoiding abbreviations when possible), your colleagues in the course and I will likely not be able to follow your talk (or report). Similarly, if you do not define robustness, a more general audience will not follow your talk.

    "text": "This is your opportunity to get feedback on how you’re structuring your ideas for your final presentation and report. Your presentation and report should tell the same story, but they should be appropriate for the context and audience. Your presentation is 15 minutes, so you need to deliver a tight and clear high-level story about your decision analysis. Your report is a draft of several sections of your next peer-reviewed publication about your decision analysis. You can, and should, extrapolate on context and details in this format but should not depart much from the narrative arc of your presentation. The two are great to work on simultaneously.\nIn this module, the main thing we are learning how to do is tie together the concepts from previous modules into a coherent and appropriate end-to-end analytical framework that address our decision problem. As such, this is the time for you in both presentation and report form to lay out:\n\nWhat is the decision problem?\nWhy is it important?\nHow are decisions made right now?\nWhat is the state-of-the-art in understanding this problem and status quo?\nWhat room is there for progress?\nWhat gap do you address?\n\nHow can you simply characterize your main refinement and contribution?\nOne way to do this convincingly is to frame it as a “status quo + 1” type of story (or something analogous)\nIt can help to focus on one key part of the logic of the overarching DMDU approach (e.g., this study focuses on trade-offs, this study focuses on how accounting for deep uncertainties reveals that currently preferred strategies may have high regret)\n\nHow will you address this in your study?\n\nWhat is “real” and “stylized” in your approach?\nWhat is out of scope?\n\nWhat do you hypothesize you will find?\nWhat are your plans to connect your decision analysis insights to decision-makers?\n\nFor both your presentation and report, imagine a general science audience. This means that you don’t have to completely simplify your language like you might for interviews with journalists, but you should define concepts that are specific to your field and the kind of decision analysis we learned in this course. For example, if you refer to parameters in your model without clarification (e.g., with a schematic representation of your model and avoiding abbreviations when possible), your colleagues in the course and I will likely not be able to follow your talk (or report). Similarly, if you do not define robustness, a more general audience will not follow your talk. And, if you do not define how you operationalize robustness in your setting, and why, your colleagues in the course and I will have a hard time evaluating your approach.\n\n\nConsider the presentation instructions and rubric.

    "text": "Your guiding question for this report is:\n“What are the key uncertainties in my decision analysis and how will I address them?”\nIt may be helpful to think of this as a rough draft of (a sizable component of) the Methods section of your paper. The more you include in your write-up, the more progress you make on your paper and the more feedback you get on your current analysis plan. Please consult this week’s readings to see papers with strong Methods text describing the key uncertainties in a decision analysis and how the authors address them.\nWhile you have flexibility for structuring your response to this guiding question, I would like you to produce a XLRM diagram for this assignment. Each key uncertainty you identify will end up as an “X” in your XLRM. You may take any classification approach you’d like for identifying the components in “X” and expanding on how you identified them and plan to address them, but I recommend a few representations from Srikrishnan et al. (2022). I think the whole article includes useful information for documenting your uncertainty considerations and analysis, but in particular you may benefit from considering the taxonomy of uncertainty types in Table 1, the model coupling diagrams in Figure 4, and the final section on best practices.\n\nSrikrishnan, V., Lafferty, D. C., Wong, T. E., Lamontagne, J. R., Quinn, J. D., Sharma, S., et al. (2022). Uncertainty analysis in multi‐sector systems: Considerations for risk analysis, projection, and planning for complex systems. Earths Future, 10(8). https://doi.org/10.1029/2021ef002644\nYou may feel trepidation about over-committing to a particular uncertain factor in your “X” and/or an analysis plan for addressing some uncertainties. I encourage you to embrace that feeling and take an inquiring approach to addressing it. For example, perhaps you feel that you lack the data to calibrate a parameter and you’re unsure about how to respresent it: you could use wide uniform priors or you could use different discrete values seen in the literature as scenarios. For this assignment, you do not have to choose an option - identifying your options and thinking through various pros/cons of different approaches is valuable. When you write your Methods text for your paper, regardless of what you choose, you should be able to defend your choice and justify it against defensible alternatives (or test that results are not sensitive to using a defensible alternative).\nAs with the last assignment, your report does not have to be in an essay form. You should write all ideas as complete sentences, even if you incorporate bullet and sub-bullets into your report structure. In addition to a XLRM, I think that a table with priors on parameters, a table documenting data sources, figure sketches, etc., could be helpful for drafting a comprehensive response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\nThe clearer your decision analyslis framing, the easier it is to identify key uncertainties and how to address them for your decision analysis. I recommend you think of the modules as cumulatively building on each other, not independent. That means that as you think about uncertainties in more detail, you may want to refine your analysis’s framing."

You can check the compatible Python versions here. I created an environment ucuq_book with python version 3.12 and was able to run the notebooks locally.\nMake sure your environment is activated and cd to your local repository. Run pip install . to install all the packages you need to run the tutorials. I also installed ipykernel to set up the environment as a kernel and run the code in VSCode.\n\n\n\nChoose the tutorial to run and adapt for your project data\nTake a look at the online tutorials and identify the uncertainty analyses that you can envision running with your project data. Pick the one that you feel is the most relevant for your decision analysis goals and run this notebook locally. If you feel that none of these tutorials map well to your goals, let’s chat ;)\n\n\nRun the uncertainty analysis you chose on your project data\nThis is optional, but recommended. It is likely easier for you to run the uncertainty analysis in the directory where you work on your decision analysis. Figure out which packages to install into your project environment to run the uncertainty analysis you tried out in the previous step. Apply this uncertainty analysis with your decision analysis model. You do not have to successfully execute the uncertainty analysis to receive the full grade on this lab, but I recommend you try because it is more synergistic with your project than running code for a generic tutorial.\n\n\nExplain the uncertainty analysis you ran and its interpretation\nFor your lab report, please submit a concise write-up on the uncertainty analysis you ran and its interpretation for the underlying data. I recommend calibrating your writing content and tone for manuscript style (e.g., see the “Sensitivity Analysis” section of the Methods in this paper and also see how the authors interpret the results of this procedure in the Results subsection “Uncertainties that drive the variance of projected damages”). I expect the following qualities in your text:\n\na clear English explanation of the analysis plan\n\nthis includes emphasizing what question(s) the analysis addresses and why it is appropriate for the problem at hand\n\njustification of the chosen sampling plan and sample size\nspecific reference to the analysis results\n\ne.g., include a figure (or more than one) in your report\n\nthoughtful interpretation\n\nthis includes highlighting key assumptions\n\naccurate references\n\nyou might only cite the MSD book and references within it, but you might also find it helpful to look beyond those\n\n\nIf you ran the analysis on your project data, you only have to explain the analysis and interpretation for that example.\n\n\nSubmit your lab report\nFor the online training, you can send me the pdf of your lab report. I do not need to see any code, but you are welcome to share your repositories with me if you would like me to take a look. I recommend wrapping up your notebook and lab report into a GitHub repository so that you can bolster your online portfolio, but I understand that this is time-intensive so it is not required."

We will create a fake digital elevation grid, a fake built environment, and fake flood scenarios.\nBelow, we define a function to create an elevation grid for the city. We use numpy because it’s a great tool for setting up our 2d array. We will use a meshgrid to set up our grid.\nPlease read the comments and test out any lines of code you want to understand better. I encourage you to reference the numpy documentation to read about any functions you’re seeing for the first time.\n\n\nCode\ndef create_terrain(width=100, height=80):\n    \"\"\"\n    Create an elevation grid using numpy meshgrid\n\n    Key features:\n        - Rivers are the lowest elevations (like real topography)\n        - Land slopes toward rivers creating natural drainage\n        - Floodplains are flat areas adjacent to rivers\n        - Higher elevations are away from water\n\n    Keyword arguments:\n    width -- the number of columns in our elevation grid\n    height -- the number of rows in our elevation grid\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set seed for reproducible terrain\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(42)\n\n    # Create coordinate grids\n    x = np.linspace(0, width/10, width)\n    y = np.linspace(0, height/10, height)\n    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)\n\n    # Define river path (straight east-west through middle)\n    river_center_y = height // 2\n    \n    # Create a slightly meandering river path\n    river_path = river_center_y + 6 * np.sin(np.linspace(0, 3*np.pi, width))\n    \n    # Calculate distance from each point to the river\n    # Elevation increases with distance from water\n    distance_to_river = np.zeros((height, width))\n    \n    for i in range(height):\n        for j in range(width):\n            river_y_at_x = river_path[j]\n            distance_to_river[i, j] = abs(i - river_y_at_x)\n    \n    # Create elevation based on distance to water\n    # Start with river at elevation 0, then build up from there\n    \n    # Base elevation: increases as you move away from river\n    elevation = distance_to_river * 1.2  # 1.2m rise per grid cell from river\n    \n    # Add gentle regional slope (slightly higher in the east)\n    elevation += X * 1.5\n    \n    # Add some rolling hills in areas far from the river\n    upland_mask = distance_to_river &gt; 10\n    hill_effect = np.where(upland_mask, \n                          8 * np.sin(X * 0.6) * np.cos(Y * 0.5), \n                          0)\n    elevation += hill_effect\n    \n    # Create realistic floodplain (very flat near river)\n    floodplain_mask = distance_to_river &lt; 3\n    elevation[floodplain_mask] = distance_to_river[floodplain_mask] * 0.3 + X[floodplain_mask] * 0.5\n    \n    # Ensure river channel is the absolute lowest point\n    river_mask = distance_to_river &lt; 1\n    elevation[river_mask] = X[river_mask] * 0.2  # Gentle downstream slope\n    \n    # Add small-scale variation\n    elevation += np.random.normal(0, 0.5, elevation.shape)\n    \n    # Ensure no negative elevations\n    elevation = np.maximum(elevation, 0)\n    \n    return elevation, distance_to_river\n\n# Generate terrain\nterrain, river_distance = create_terrain()\n\n# Create a much better visualization\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))\n\n# Elevation map with proper terrain colormap\nim1 = ax.imshow(terrain, cmap='terrain', origin='lower')\nax.axis('off')\nplt.colorbar(im1, ax=ax, label='Elevation (m)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we’ll use both numpy and pandas to set up our building inventory.

Many of the town’s citizens want economic development, but development will increase the pollution flowing into the lake. The citizens know that lakes such as theirs can exhibit a threshold behavior where a small pollution increase past some level may cause a clear lake to turn suddenly and sometimes irreversibly cloudy. The citizens seek a development plan that preserves the clarity of their lake, cognizant of their widely divergent values regarding environmental quality and growth, as well their divergent opinions about the level where the pollution threshold for their lake might lie. The town’s citizens also know that once permits are issued, buildings built, and pollution begins to flow it may become difficult to reverse course. Nonetheless, they must decide how much pollution they should allow to best balance their economic and environmental goals.”\n\n\n\nShallow Lake Model diagram from Vivek Srikrishnan’s Fall 2025 Environmental Systems Analysis Slides\n\n\nThe lake naturally loses and gains phosphorus (P). The lake can exist in one of two states. The desirable state, called an oligotrophic state, exists with low nutrient inputs, low to moderate levels of plant production, and relatively clear water. The undesirable state, called an eutrophic state, exists with high nutrient levels, high levels of plant production, low biodiversity, and murky water. The introduction of economic activity to the lake increases the risk of eutrophication.\nLempert and Collins (2007) represent the lake problem with the following equation (with a little clarification from revisiting Peterson et al., (2003)): \\[\nX_{t+1} =\n\\begin{cases}\n    BX_t + b_t + L_t & \\text{if } X_t &lt; X^{\\text{crit}} \\\\\n    BX_t + r + b_t + L_t & \\text{if } X_t \\geq X^{\\text{crit}}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(X_{t}\\) is the P concentration at time \\(t\\), \\(B\\) is the proportion of P retained in the lake each year, \\(b_{t} = (\\bar{b}, \\omega)\\) is the natural pollution flow into the lake assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean \\(\\bar{b}\\) and standard deviation \\(\\omega\\), \\(L_{t}\\) is the anthropogenic pollution flow, and \\(r\\) is the amount of P recycled and maintained in the lake. \\(X^{\\text{crit}}\\) is the critical P concentration at which P recycling begins.\nThe two alternating equilibrium values are found by letting \\(X_{t+1} = X{t}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{l}\n    X_{1*} = \\frac{\\bar{b} + L}{1 - B} & \\text{if } X_{1*} &lt; X^{\\text{crit}} \\\\\n    X_{2*} = \\frac{r + \\bar{b} + L}{1 - B} & \\text{if } X_{2*} \\geq X^{\\text{crit}}\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nIf \\(X_{1*} &lt; X^{\\text{crit}}\\) an oligotrophic equilibrium exists, and if \\(X_{2*} \\geq X^{\\text{crit}}\\) a eutrophic equilibrium also exists. Because the equilibrium value of \\(X\\) depends upon the P loading, changes in P loading can cause equilibrium point to appear or disappear. Figure 2 from Peterson et al., (2003), shown below, illustrates how changes in P loading can irreversibly alter the lake system’s outcomes:\n\n\n\nAn illustration of the P dynamics model. In example (A), low P loading results in a single stable oligotrophic equilibrium. In (B), at a higher P loading the same lake has two stable equilibrium values—one oligotrophic (the lower point) and one eutrophic (the higher point)\n\n\nLempert and Collins (2007) assume that the citizens of the town gain utility by adding pollutants to the lake, but suffer a loss of utility if the lake becomes eutrophic. They represent the utility function as:\n\\[\nU'_{t} =\n\\begin{cases}\n    \\alpha L_{t} - \\phi (L_{t} - L_{t-1}) & \\text{if } X_t &lt; X^{\\text{crit}} \\\\\n    \\alpha L_{t} - \\beta - \\phi (L_{t} - L_{t-1}) & \\text{if } X_t \\geq X^{\\text{crit}}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are constants. \\(\\beta &gt;&gt; \\alpha L_{t}\\), representing that the loss of utility in the eutrophic state (e.g., recreational and aesthetic utility) is large compared to the utility gained from pollution. The citizens also may suffer economic losses, such as costs of retrofitting infrastructure with pollution control equipment or underutilization of capital stock, if they are forced to decrease emissions below their previously allowed level. These costs are small compared to those of the eutrophic state, given by:\n\\[\n\\phi (L_{t} - L_{t-1}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n    0 & \\text{if } L_{t} \\geq L_{t-1} \\\\\n    \\varphi & \\text{if } L_{t} &lt; L_{t-1}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\varphi\\) is a constant and \\(\\varphi &lt;&lt; \\frac{\\beta}{L_{t-1} - L_{t}}\\).\nThe town’s decision problem is to choose a pollution series, \\(\\mathbf{L_t}\\),\nLempert and Collins propose a policy rule that has three decision variables: the initial level of pollution, \\(L_{0}\\), the max amount of pollution per time period, \\(\\Delta L\\), and a safety margin, \\(S\\). This decision strategy takes the following form:\n\\[\nL_{t+1} =\n\\begin{cases}\n    Max\\{0, Min[L_{t} + \\Delta L, L^{\\text{target}}_{t}]\\} & \\text{for } t \\geq 1 \\\\\n    L_{0} & \\text{for } t = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere the target emission level at time \\(t\\) is given by:\n\\[\nL^{\\text{target}} =\n\\begin{cases}\n    (1 - B) \\langle X^{\\text{crit}}_{t} \\rangle - \\bar{b} - S\\omega  & \\text{if } X_{t} &lt; X^{\\text{crit}} \\\\\n    \\langle X^{\\text{crit}}_{t} \\rangle - BX_{t} - r - \\bar{b} - S\\omega & \\text{if } X_{t} \\geq X^{\\text{crit}}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nand \\(\\langle X^{\\text{crit}}_{t} \\rangle\\) is the town’s estimated critical threshold at the current time period. Please refer to the paper for the formulation.\nUnder an expected utility maximization framework for decision-making, the town aims to maximize the present value of utility: \\(PV(U) = \\sum_{t} \\frac{U_{t}}{(1 + d)^{t}}\\), where \\(d\\) is the citizens’ discount rate. Given the available information to estimate \\(\\langle X^{\\text{crit}}_{t} \\rangle\\), the town can find the optimal values for their decision variables. As we’ll see later in the lab (and as you already know from reading the paper), whether this is the right decision to make depends on how much you believe the information you have to estimate \\(\\langle X^{\\text{crit}}_{t} \\rangle\\).\nThe basecase values of model parameters are as follows:\n\n\n\nParameter\nValue\n\n\n\n\nRetained phosphorous (B)\n.2\n\n\nMean of natural emissions (\\(\\hat{b}\\))\n.1\n\n\nInitial P concentration (\\(X_{0}\\))\n\\(\\hat{b}\\)/(1 - B) = .125\n\n\nStd of natural emissions \\(\\omega\\)\n.04\n\n\nRecycling rate (r)\n.25\n\n\nStd of measured \\(X^{\\text{crit}}\\) (\\(\\gamma\\))\n.05\n\n\nDistance from \\(X^{\\text{crit}}\\) required for learning (\\(\\lambda\\))\n.1\n\n\nNoise exponent (q)\n2\n\n\nInitial estimate of observed \\(X^{\\text{crit}}\\) variance\n.02\n\n\nDiscount rate (d)\n.03\n\n\nUtility from pollution (\\(\\alpha\\))\n1\n\n\nEutrophic cost (\\(\\beta\\))\n10\n\n\nEmissions reduction cost (\\(\\varphi\\))\n1\n\n\n\nNote: While the table in the text has \\(\\varphi\\) as 10, the text clearly states that this emissions reduction cost is much smaller than the eutrophic cost so it is a typo. I’m guessing it’s supposed to be 1 (similarly, the initial estimate of observed \\(X^{\\text{crit}}\\) variance is a typo in the paper’s table).\n\n\n\nDecision-making under uncertainty\nNote that I was not able to reproduce the results from Lempert and Collins completely. There are a few typos (e.g., see their Table on parameter values and the reported initial estiamte of observed \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\) and the one I was able to update based on other text in the paper). There are a few decisions and implementation choices I can’t back out without more guidance, but I was able to reproduce the most relevant behavior of the inflows and policies. I made a few updates relative to the policy rules as written in the manuscript:\n\nI estimate the new best guess for \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\) based on the current best guess for variance. The notation as currently written suggests we calculate the new variance before updating our mean estimate.\nI limit updates on standard deviation of \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\) to double our intial guess. If we don’t do this, there is too much noise in early draws and we can’t identify when our initial guess is lower than \\(X^{\\text{true}}_{\\text{crit}}\\). I think this biases our representation a bit more towards trusting our priors than the Lempert and Collins paper, but I can’t otherwise figure out how to get the same learning behavior as them for Strategy A when \\(X^{\\text{true}}_{\\text{crit}}\\) = .9.\n\nAnyone who wants to review the paper and code and reconcile any major differences with explanations or code updates is more than welcome!\nBecause the code below does reproduce key behavior of the inflows and policies, all of the lessons about robustness are the same and that’s the key point of this lab.\nOk! Moving on…\nAdapting the narrative of Lempert and Collins slightly, suppose the town reviewed scientific evidence of nearby lakes and concludes that \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\) lies between .3 and .9. The current best evidence suggets \\(X_{\\text{crit}} \\sim N(.8, .138)\\).\nIf the town has 100% confidence in this belief, the optimal strategy (called Strategy A) has: \\(L_{0} = .31\\), \\(\\Delta L = .027\\) \\(S = 2.8\\)\nAssume that the true value of \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\) is .9. What does the pollution concentration of the lake look like over 100 years? What about if the true value is .3?\n\n\nCode\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import truncnorm\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# ------------------------\n# Parameters (Table I / paper)\n# ------------------------\nB = 0.20           # retained phosphorus\nb_bar = 0.10       # mean natural emissions\nomega = 0.04       # std dev natural emissions\nr = 0.25           # recycling jump when X &gt;= Xcrit\ngamma_obs = 0.05   # baseline observation noise std\nlambda_learn = 0.10\nq_noise = 2.0\ninitial_var = 0.02\nalpha = 1.0\nbeta = 10.0\nphi = 1.0 # table says 10 but the text says &lt;&lt; beta\ndiscount_rate = 0.03\n\n# Strategy A (given)\nstrategy_A = {\"L0\": 0.31, \"dL\": 0.027, \"S\": 2.8}\n\n# Simulation controls\nT = 100                # years\nNsim = 100             # ensemble size for mean / quantiles (set e.g., 100 for demo)\nSEED = 42\nrng_global = np.random.default_rng(SEED)\n\n# Initial estimate used by the town\ninitial_est_mean = 0.787\ninitial_est_var = initial_var\nest_lower = .3\nest_upper = .9\n\n# ------------------------\n# Helper functions implementing paper's learning and policy rules\n# ------------------------\ndef gamma_t_func(Xt, Xcrit_true, gamma=gamma_obs, lam=lambda_learn, q=q_noise):\n    \"\"\"Equation (6): observation noise depends on proximity to threshold.\"\"\"\n    if Xt &gt;= Xcrit_true:\n        return float(gamma)\n    exponent = ((Xcrit_true -

When the assessment is badly wrong (bottom panel, true Xcrit = 0.3), the initial policy overcommits — the emissions (and then concentration) rise, the town’s estimate of \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\) is revised downward as observations arrive, and emissions are sharply cut only after the system has already been driven into the eutrophic equilibrium. This illustrates how a predict‑then‑act rule that trusts a single prior can be fragile under deep uncertainty.\nHow much would the town regret going with Strategy A if \\(X^{\\text{true}}_{\\text{crit}}\\) = .3?\nTo estimate this, we are going to consider the town’s uncertainty about their estimate of the value of \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\) as well as epistemic uncertainty about whether this is the correct distribution to characterize \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\).\nRecall from lecture that the regret of action a in state x is:\n\\(R_{a}(x) = Max_{a'}[PV(U_{a'}(x))] - PV(U_{a}(x))\\),\nthe difference between the present value expected utility of the optimal action in a considered state of the world and the considered action’s present value expected utility in that state of the world.\nConsidering the probability distribution \\(p_{i}(x)\\) over possible states of the world, the expected regret of action a on distribution i is:\n\\[\n\\bar{R}_{a, i} = \\int_{x} R_{a}(x)p_{i}(x)dx\n\\]\nI use actions, a, as opposed to strategies in this formulation because it is consistent with the original derivation in Savage (1951). Otherwise, the notation is consistent with the formulation in Lempert and Collins. x refers to the possible values for \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\) and i refers to a specific prior distribution for \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\).\nFor different values of \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\), we can estimate the town’s expected regret for placing all of their trust in the commissioned science assessment. Lempert and Collins provide several other strategies, B-G. For different values of \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\), we can calculate which of the strategies A-G is optimal and then calculate the expected regret of choosing Strategy A based on the town’s prior distribution for A. Lempert and Collins presumably identify the optimal strategy for each \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\) and calculate regret based on that, but we are just going to use the strategies provided to simplify things.\nWe’ll start with the example of \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\) = .3, which corresponds to the bottom panel of the figure we generated above. At \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\) = .3, Strategy G is optimal out of the strategies under consideration. Lempert and Collins don’t report the decision variables for this strategy, but we can get a very similar strategy to G by looking at Figure 6. It looks like \\(L_{0} = 0.01\\), \\(\\Delta L = 0.01\\) and \\(S = 5.8\\).\nWe’ll build up slowly to expected regret over a prior distribution by first calculating the regret of Strategy A in the scenario where \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\) = 0.3. We need to calculate:\n\\(R_{A}(0.3) = PV(U_{G}(0.3)) - PV(U_{A}(0.3))\\)\nWe’ll calculate the expected present value of utility of each strategy when \\(X_{\\text{crit}}\\) = .3 and then the difference.\n\n\nCode\n# Strategy G (guessed from Fig. 6)\nstrategy_G = {\"L0\": 0.01, \"dL\": 0.01, \"S\": 5.8}\n\n# Create the utility array for strategy G\nstrat_g_U = np.zeros((n_x, Nsim, T))\n\n# Run ensemble for Strategy G\nfor i in range(Nsim):\n    # create per-run rng for observation draws (do not re-seed inside loop)\n    rng_i = np.random.default_rng(SEED + 1000 + i)\n    for j, xcrit in enumerate(xcrit_list):\n        out = simulate_one_run_with_learning(Xcrit_true=xcrit,\n                                             policy=strategy_G,\n                                             T=T,\n                                             rng=rng_i,\n                                             est_mean_init=initial_est_mean,\n                                             est_var_init=initial_est_var)\n        strat_g_U[j, i, :] = out[\"U\"]\n\n# Compute present value of utility.\n# Discount factors (length T)\nt = np.arange(T)\ndiscount_factors = 1.0 / ((1.0 + discount_rate) ** t)\n\npv_A_samples = np.sum(all_U[0, :, :] * discount_factors, axis=1) \npv_G_samples = np.sum(strat_g_U[0, :, :] * discount_factors, axis=1)\n\n# Calculate expected values and report both and difference\nmean_pv_A = pv_A_samples.mean()\nmean_pv_G = pv_G_samples.mean()\n\ng_best_regret = mean_pv_G - mean_pv_A\n\nprint(\"Strategy A: mean PV = {:.2f}\".format(mean_pv_A))\nprint(\"Strategy G: mean PV = {:.2f}\".format(mean_pv_G))\nprint(\" Regret = {:.2f}\".format(g_best_regret))\n\n\nStrategy A: mean PV = -310.81\nStrategy G: mean PV = -17.38\n Regret = 293.43\n\n\nAnd we can do the same for when \\(X^{\\text{crit}}\\) = .9 but this time we treat Strategy A as the optimal policy.\n\n\nCode\n# Compute present value of utility.\n# Discount factors (length T)\nt = np.arange(T)\ndiscount_factors = 1.0 / ((1.0 + discount_rate) ** t)\n\npv_A_samples = np.sum(all_U[-1, :, :] * discount_factors, axis=1) \npv_G_samples = np.sum(strat_g_U[-1, :, :] * discount_factors, axis=1)\n\n# Calculate expected values and report both and difference\nmean_pv_A = pv_A_samples.mean()\nmean_pv_G = pv_G_samples.mean()\n\na_best_regret = mean_pv_A - mean_pv_G\n\nprint(\"Strategy A: mean PV = {:.2f}\".format(mean_pv_A))\nprint(\"Strategy G: mean PV = {:.2f}\".format(mean_pv_G))\nprint(\" Regret = {:.2f}\".format(a_best_regret))\n\n\nStrategy A: mean PV = 15.24\nStrategy G: mean PV = 7.27\n Regret = 7.98\n\n\n\nCriterion 1: trading-off optimality for less sensitivity to unverifiable assumptions\nHow do we reconcile the differences in present value expected utility and expected regret? Lempert and Collins define a robust strategy as one that will have a smaller value of the weighted average of the best and worst case regrets compared to the strategy that optimizes expected utility, which we can represent as:\n\\[\nV_{s} = z*\\bar{R}_{s, \\text{best}} + (1-z)*\\bar{R}_{s, \\text{worst}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(0 \\leq z \\leq 1\\) and represents our belief in \\(p_{\\text{best}(x)}\\).\nWhen \\(z\\) = 1, there is only one probability distribution under consideration - the town’s best guess. In this case, the equation above preserves the ordering of strategies produced by an expected utility calculation. When \\(z\\) = 0, the criterion is equivalent to avoiding worst-case utility. When \\(z\\) is in between, it is possible to identify the strategy that minimizes expected regret as a function of a decisionmaker’s odds that the initial probability distribution is correct (Fig. 7 in the paper). The odds are \\(\\frac{z}{(1-z)}\\).\nHow confident does the town have to be in the scientific assessment to stick with Strategy A? To do this, we’ll calculate \\(V_{s}\\) for strategies A and G over a wide range of values for \\(z\\). Since we are only considering strategies A and G:\n\\(\\bar{R}_{A, \\text{best}}\\) is 0, \\(\\bar{R}_{A, \\text{worst}}\\) is the regret we calculated when \\(X_{crit}\\) = 0.3, \\(\\bar{R}_{G, \\text{best}}\\) is the regret we calculated when \\(X_{crit}\\) = 0.9, and \\(\\bar{R}_{G, \\text{worst}}\\) is 0.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculated V_s\ndef weighted_regret(z, best_regret, worst_regret):\n    return z*(best_regret) + (1-z)*(worst_regret)\n\n# Odds from 0.01 to 100\n# Construct odds grid (log-spaced) and convert to z = odds/(1+odds)\nodds = np.logspace(-2, 3, 500)\nz_list = odds / (1.0 + odds)\n\n# Calculate V_A and V_G over odds\nV_A = z_list * 0 + (1 - z_list) * g_best_regret\nV_G = z_list * a_best_regret + (1 - z_list) * 0\n\n# Plot odds against weighted regret\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(odds, V_A, label='V_A (weighted regret for A)', linestyle='-')\nax.plot(odds, V_G, label='V_G (weighted regret for G)', linestyle='--')\n\nax.set_ylabel(\"V_s (weighted expected regret)\", size=14)\n\nax.set_xscale('log')\n# integer ticks to show (only those within the odds range will be used)\ninteger_ticks = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000]\n# Choose x limits: show more of odds &gt; 10 — e.g., start at 0.1 to include small odds too\nax.set_xlim(0.1, 1000)\n# Keep only ticks that fall inside the x limits\nticks_in_range = [t for t in integer_ticks if (t &gt;= ax.get_xlim()[0] and t &lt;= ax.get_xlim()[1])]\nax.set_xticks(ticks_in_range)\n# Label ticks as integers (no decimals)\nax.set_xticklabels([str(int(t)) for t in ticks_in_range])\nax.set_xlabel(\"Odds of Strategy A's Priors\", size=14)\n\nax.set_ylim([0, 50])\n\nax.tick_params(labelsize=12)\n\nax.legend(fontsize='large')\nfig.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on this figure and fig. 7 in the paper, we can make a few observations about robust decision-making with this criterion. First, because of how poorly strategy A performs under low \\(X^{true}_{crit}\\), the town should be very confident in the scientific assessment to go with strategy A. Second, having more strategy options (fig. 7 in the paper) can help decisionmakers make more robust decisions under a wide range of beliefs.\n\n\nCriterion 2: performing well over a wide range of plausible futures\nWe’ll now shift our attention to a second robustness criterion: satisficing over a wide range of futures. While decisionmakers may want to identify satisficing strategies over multiple objectives, Lempert and Collins use regret for this criterion. This translates to finding a strategy that has low regret for many values of \\(X^{true}_{crit}\\). In the paper, they define arbitrary cutoffs for what constitutes “good enough” regret. In practice, analysts and decisionmakers often iterate on defining a satisficing threshold based on visualizations about strategy performance over a wide range of futures and refined sets of strategies.\nWe’re going to consider both the net present value of expected utility and regret for strategies A and G.\n\n\nCode\n# Helpful for getting the pv for multiple xcrit\ndef compute_pvs_from_U(U_array, discount_rate):\n    U = np.asarray(U_array)\n    t = np.arange(U.shape[2])\n    discount_factors = 1.0 / ((1.0 + discount_rate) ** t)\n    pv = (U * discount_factors).sum(axis=2) \n    return pv\n\npv_A_samples = compute_pvs_from_U(all_U, discount_rate)     \npv_G_samples = compute_pvs_from_U(strat_g_U, discount_rate)  \n\n# Mean present value over each xcrit\n# Same index as all_U and strat_g_U\nmean_pv_A = pv_A_samples.mean(axis=1)  \nmean_pv_G = pv_G_samples.mean(axis=1) \n\n# Calculate regret\n# Two strategies under consideration, so regret is\n# 0 when one of the strategies is better for a xcrit value\npv_best_by_x = np.maximum(mean_pv_A, mean_pv_G) \nregret_A = pv_best_by_x - mean_pv_A\nregret_G = pv_best_by_x - mean_pv_G\n\n# Plot regret over critical x values in one panel\n# Plot present value expected utility in the other\n# x values (e.g., xcrit_list)\nx = np.array(xcrit_list)\nn_x = len(x)\n\n# bar width and positions\nwidth = 0.35\nxpos = np.arange(n_x)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=2, sharex=True, figsize=(10,6))\n\n# Top: expected PV bars\nax0 = ax[0]\nax0.bar(xpos - width/2, mean_pv_A, width=width, color='C0', label='Strategy A')\nax0.bar(xpos + width/2, mean_pv_G, width=width, color='C1', label='Strategy G')\nax0.set_ylabel('Present value utility', size=14)\nax0.legend()\nax0.grid(axis='y', linestyle=':', alpha=0.6)\n\n# Bottom: regret bars\nax1 = ax[1]\nax1.bar(xpos - width/2, regret_A, width=width, color='C0')\nax1.bar(xpos + width/2, regret_G, width=width, color='C1')\nax1.set_ylabel('Regret', size=14)\nax1.grid(axis='y', linestyle=':', alpha=0.6)\n\n# x ticks and labels\nax1.set_xticks(xpos)\nax1.set_xticklabels([f\"{val:.2f}\" for val in x])\nax1.set_xlabel('Xcrit', size=14)\n\nax[0].set_yscale('symlog')\nax[1].set_yscale('symlog')\n\nax0.tick_params(labelsize=12)\nax1.tick_params(labelsize=12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis kind of visualization helps put into context the relative performance of the strategies for different scenarios of \\(X_{crit}\\). For example, Lempert and Collins suggest that regret &lt;= 12 is acceptable. According to our calculations, unacceptable regret only becomes an issue if the true \\(X_{crit}\\) is less than .6. From a satisficing perspective, if we wanted to ensure acceptable regret, we would prefer Strategy G because it robustly achieves that goal. We could also consider an alternative threshold, such as positive utility. Strategy G would be more robust than strategy A because it has positive utility over more scenarios of \\(X_{crit}\\). Note that the satisficing approach does not account for beliefs about the probability of different values for \\(X_{crit}\\). This may not be an appropriate assumption for all situations, but it can still be helpful to represent robustness in multiple ways.\n\n\n\nWrapping up lab\nThere is no separate lab report this week.

I highly recommend following the instructions for Connecting to GitHub with SSH.\nCreate a new Public repository called ‘ENGS 199.20 Lab 1’. Add a README, .gitignore, and License. Learn about these files if you are unfamiliar with them.\nClone your repository to your local machine. I recommend having a directory for this class and to clone the repository inside that directory.\nDownload this file as a Jupyter notebook (see the upper righthand corner of the page) and add it to your project directory. You can use whatever git workflow you’d like to do version control, but I will provide instructions for using the command line.\n\nRun git remote -v to check that your local repository is tracking the repository on GitHub.\nRun git status from this lab directory’s root to see that the notebook is untracked.\nRun git add . to track the notebook.\nRun git commit -m [message] with your own helpful message.\nUse this simple workflow when you make changes to files. If you don’t want to track a file, you can add the specific file’s location (or use wildcards and file prefixes or suffixes) to avoid tracking.\n\nFor this lab, we are going to create a small environment that allows us to plot using the seaborn package. After following these next instructions, we will be ready to run our notebook.\n\nSometimes the steps above can cause trouble! Please loop me into these struggles so we can troubleshoot together and save you time. It’s also a good opportunity to get to know the very nice and smart folks at IT who are experts with these setup problems!\nCreate a file called env-lab1.yml in your lab1 directory. Add the following contents and save:\nname: lab1\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\ndependencies:\n  - python\n  - nbconvert\n  - ipykernel\n  - seaborn\n  - jupyter\nRun mamba env create -f env-lab1.yml. Run mamba activate lab1. Set up the kernel for the environment with python -m ipykernel install --user --name lab1 --display-name lab1.\n\n\nRun Code\nBelow, I reproduce a plot from the seaborn Gallery. Make sure the lab1 kernel is set up in the notebook and then run the code block.\n\n\nCode\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set_theme(style=\"ticks\", palette=\"pastel\")\n\n# Load the example tips dataset\ntips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\n\n# Draw a nested boxplot to show bills by day and time\nsns.boxplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\",\n            hue=\"smoker\", palette=[\"m\", \"g\"],\n            data=tips)\nsns.despine(offset=10, trim=True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttractive and clear figures are very important in decision analysis. Run the cell below, which makes the figure higher resolution and makes the font more legible. Some changes reflect my personal style preferences.\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set up a figure with higher resolution\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(dpi=300)\n\n# Draw a nested boxplot to show bills by day and time\nsns.boxplot(x=\"day\",\n            y=\"total_bill\",\n            hue=\"smoker\",\n            showfliers=False,\n            palette=[\"m\", \"g\"],\n            showmeans=True,\n            meanprops={'marker': 'D',\n                       'markerfacecolor': 'firebrick',\n                       'markeredgecolor': 'firebrick'},\n            data=tips,\n            ax=ax)\n\n# Rename legend title and increase font size\nsns.move_legend(ax,\n                loc='best',\n                title='Smoker at Table?',\n                alignment='left',\n                fontsize=12,\n                title_fontsize=14)\n\n# Make tick labels more legible\nax.tick_params(labelsize=12)\n\n# Rename axis labels\nax.set_ylabel(\"Total Bill ($)\", size=14)\nax.set_xlabel(\"Day\", size=14)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of restaurant bills in dollars reported by a waiter over a period of several months, shown in boxplots. The grouping examines how total bill size is distributed across day of the week (x-axis) and whether the party included a smoker (hue). Red diamonds denote the mean restaurant bill in each group.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the link in the seaborn example, we can learn more about the tips data here.\nTo complete this lab report, add a code cell where you create a new figure that explores the relationship between variables in this dataset. It does not have to use the variables we used so far, nor do you have to use a boxplot. Make sure your tick and axis labels are at least size 12 and that the figure resolution is at least 300 dots per inch. Make sure your figure includes a caption, which must state the association considered in the exploratory visualization. In the cell after your plot, add a markdown cell where you:\n\nWrite out a caption;\nDescribe the plotted result;\nSuggest further analysis that could help uncover the relationship between these and/or other variables.\n\nSee a text example below for the revised figure from the seaborn example (note the caption underneath the revised figure on the website).\nAnalysis: On average, the waiter’s bills were similar regardless of day of the week or whether a smoker was present in the party. On Saturdays and Sundays, bills tended to be larger and more variable when smokers are in a party.\nFuture work: Lacking information on the relative frequency of bills across days of the week and smokers present in a party, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions about the associations of bill size and the considered variables. To better understand these associations, it would be helpful to show histograms in a second panel under the present plot. In addition, it’s not clear why presence of smokers in a dining party would have any association with the bill size. Other variables in the dataset, such as time of day and size of the party are likely more relevant to consider.\nNote: If you do not have experience with Python, I recommend trying to generate a new plot – the seaborn package does not really require Python knowledge to generate a new plot. However, today’s lab is not graded so you don’t have to generate a new plot, write a caption, etc., I think it’s a good opportunity to practice the lab submission workflow and ask questions now before I start grading labs.\n\n\nSubmit Code and Report\nMake sure your GitHub repository is up to date.\nExport your .ipynb as a .pdf and submit on Canvas. In your submission, share a link to your repository. Please replace “ENGS 199.20” in the top cell with your name and change the filename to include your name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinting Code to PDF\n\n\n\nBecause we included nbconvert in our computational environment, we should be able to export the .ipynb to .pdf using VS Code and get a nicely formatted file."

However, I will provide feedback on all lab reports, even if late. Your lowest lab report grade will be dropped.\n\nHow to get a 5/5 on lab\n\nGet the “right” answer for the “right” reason.\n\nBad work can accidentally lead to poor decisions (and strong analysis may not identify good decisions). It is crucial that you show your work in a traceable and understandable way so that decision-makers understand why your analysis supports certain decisions. I will grade your work for how well it demonstrates why and how you get the right answers. Because most of your code for lab report is provided with lab instructions, this mostly entails accurate references to source material (i.e., readings and code blocks/instructions from lab). However, you will be responsible for processing/presenting/interpreting results generated with lab instructions. Think about the following things when answering lab report questions:\n\nSpecific references to modeling results, figures, references, code blocks, etc., make it easier to demonstrate you got the right answer for the right reason.\nThe cleaner and clearer your code and documentation in your Jupyter notebook, the more likely I can check for correctness.\n\n\nBe as clear as possible.\n\nDecision-makers cannot read your mind. Ambiguity in decision analysis is bad decision support. Submissions that are unclear for any reason, including but not limited to unclear syntax (writing or code), lack of reasoning to support synthesis, or too much detail in writing will not be strong.\n\nThis includes being transparent about values-laden assumptions and limitations, as well as providing careful synthesis that demonstrates understanding and genuine insights.\n\n\nA good figure is worth 1,000 words\n\nVisualizations are the main way to convey results and insights to decision-mamkers. Figures should be correct and highly legible. You must:\n\nChoose the appropriate axes and label them accordingly;\nPlot the correct data series;\nInclude a descriptive legend (if it applies);\nProvide a succint descriptive caption (do not report or interpret results in a caption).\n\n\nTake your time\n\nIt is difficult to meet guidelines 1-3 in one pass. For example, on guideline 2, I tend to revise each draft of scientific manuscripts 3-4 times before sharing with co-authors, a cycle that repeats several times each paper. As another example, on guideline 3, I tend to spend at least one week working on a single figure for scientific manuscripts. This course expects you to spend roughly 3 times the in-person hours outside of course, which equates to ~10 hours. This time corresponds to one required reading, polishing your lab report (1-2 of the in-person hours each week are lab work in a class setting), and cumulatively connecting new concepts to your course project. These activities are highly synergistic, and time you spend on lab reports will pay off big for your project progress reports. Labs are also your main opportunity in the class to demonstrate to an outside audience, through your GitHub page, your decision analysis and science communication skills.",

    "text": "Your guiding question for this report is:\n“What decision problem will you focus on for your project?”\nHere are a few examples of decision problem statements:\n\nWhat height, if at all, should a homeowner elevate their home to defend against flooding?\nWhat federal funding rules promote economic efficiency and social equity in disaster-risk reduction outcomes?\n\nIn addition to answering this guiding question, your report should be responsive to the content in lectures 1 and 2. Because of the focus of this class, you must explain why your problem is a wicked climate problem. You should also develop an initial framing for a decision analysis on your problem. The further you get into sketching out the structure and analysis, the better! That said, I don’t expect you to submit a full conceptual model, plan for a ViMM, XLRM, etc., You might benefit from experimenting with these boundary objects, and proposing partial versions, but at this stage it may be better to answer and/or describe your guiding questions for framing (and to ask me questions, such as whether I know of references that can help you learn more about something you think is relevant).\nYour report does not have to be in an essay form. I want you to make cumulative progress on your project throughout the term. So, while you might find it helpful to write in the same form as your final report, you can also complete your report in a structure that works better for you in the planning stages of a project. For example, some students may find it helpful to structure their report in a questions and answers format, or in a detailed outline, or in a hybrid form. While you do not have to write your report as an essay, you should write all ideas as complete sentences (even if you incorporate bullet and sub-bullets into your report structure).

    "text": "Your guiding question for this report is:\n“What decision problem will you focus on for your project?”\nHere are a few examples of decision problem statements:\n\nWhat height, if at all, should a homeowner elevate their home to defend against flooding?\nWhat federal funding rules promote economic efficiency and social equity in disaster-risk reduction outcomes?\n\nIn addition to answering this guiding question, your report should be responsive to the content in lectures 1 and 2. Because of the focus of this class, you must explain why your problem is a wicked climate problem. You should also develop an initial framing for a decision analysis on your problem. The further you get into sketching out the structure and analysis, the better! That said, I don’t expect you to submit a full conceptual model, plan for a ViMM, XLRM, etc., You might benefit from experimenting with these boundary objects, and proposing partial versions, but at this stage it may be better to answer and/or describe your guiding questions for framing (and to ask me questions, such as whether I know of references that can help you learn more about something you think is relevant).\nYour report does not have to be in an essay form. I want you to make cumulative progress on your project throughout the term. So, while you might find it helpful to write in the same form as your final report, you can also complete your report in a structure that works better for you in the planning stages of a project. For example, some students may find it helpful to structure their report in a questions and answers format, or in a detailed outline, or in a hybrid form. While you do not have to write your report as an essay, you should write all ideas as complete sentences (even if you incorporate bullet and sub-bullets into your report structure).

    "text": "Course Description\nThe 21st century’s biggest challenges resist traditional problem-solving approaches. These wicked problems (Rittel & Webber, 1973), such as addressing climate risks, can’t be solved with standard engineering methods because they involve multiple stakeholders with competing goals, uncertainties that evolve over time, and complex system behaviors we’re still trying to understand. Decision-makers need new tools and frameworks that can handle this complexity while still pointing the way toward practical action. In this course, students will learn about state-of-the-art technical methods that offer promise for meeting decision-making needs to respond to climate risks. Topics range from complex systems analysis to reinforcement learning, and multi-objective robust decision-making.\n\nRittel, H. W. J., & Webber, M. M. (1973).

    "text": "Teaching Approach\n\nCourse Structure\nThe course is divided into several modules and each week is generally structured as follows:\n\nMondays: Lecture\nTuesdays: Occasional X-hour for programming tutorials\nWednesdays: Student-led presentations or serious game followed by a group discussion\nFridays: Computational labs\n\n\n\nExpectations of Students\nThis course will require your sustained attention. Students are expected to:\n\ncome prepared to class (e.g., by carefully reading and synthesizing the reading assignments before class and being ready to present their synthesis in class);\nactively contribute to the group discussions and activities;\nsubmit the assignments on time; and\nattend office hours as needed.\n\nStudents should expect to spend roughly three times the in-course hours outside the classroom for readings and assignments.\n\nCommunication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, Be Excellent To Teach Other\n\n\n\nWe all make mistakes in our communications with one another, both when speaking and listening. Be mindful of how spoken or written language might be misunderstood, and be aware that, for a variety of reasons, how others perceive your words and actions may not be exactly how you intended them. At the same time, it is also essential that we be respectful and interpret each other’s comments and actions in good faith.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting Tips\n\n\n\n\nDo not take screenshots of code. I will not respond. Screenshots can be difficult to read and limit accessibility. Put your code on GitHub, share the link, and point to specific line numbers if relevant, or provide a simple, self-contained example of the problem you’re running into.\nIf you wait until the day an assignment is due (or even late the previous night) to ask a question on Canvas, there is a strong chance that I will not see your post prior to the deadline.\nIf you see unanswered questions and you have some insight, please answer! This class will work best when we all work together as a community.",

    "section": "Assessments",
    "text": "Assessments\n\nActive Participation: 10%\nCollaboration and collegiality are important skills for interdisciplinary decision analysts. We will practice these skills in the following ways:\n\nAsking questions during course meetings and/or office hours;\nParticipating in serious games and group discussions;\nProviding constructive feedback on student-led presentations;\nCollaborating on computational labs and managing a shared GitHub repository.\n\nGraduate students will additionally practice these skills by leading a journal club session on one of the assigned readings.\nNote that passively attending class will not yield full participation points. Participation points are not free. I will record lectures, student-led presentations and group discussions, and lab tutorials and post them to Canvas. It is possible to attend these sessions remotely on Zoom, but this can affect your ability to actively participate. It is not possible to attend some of the Wednesday active learning sessions remotely and these will not be recorded.\n\n\nComputational Labs: 30%\nWe will use class time for hands-on programming exercises to give you guided practice applying the concepts and methods from class. These labs will be done in groups; if you cannot bring a laptop to class, you will be able to (and are encouraged to) work with other students, though you must turn in your own lab report for grading. All labs will cover either a set of programming tools or a case study, such as reproducing analyses in peer-reviewed studies (e.g., https://github.com/abpoll/j40_gc/tree/v1.0.0-pub and https://github.com/jdossgollin/2022-elevation-robustness).\nLab reports are due before the following lab.\n\n\nCourse Project: 60%\nThe goal of the course project is to develop and report on an actionable plan for implementing a quantitative decision analysis for the student’s topic of choice. This project can be highly synergistic with thesis projects and students are encouraged to choose a decision problem related to their thesis if they are working on one.\nStudents will work on this project throughout the entire term, with ongoing evaluations and three major evaluation milestones as follows:\n\nProject Progress Reports: At the end of each course module, students will have one week to submit a progress report that details a technically appropriate plan to integrate methods covered in the module in a quantitative decision analysis. A list of guiding questions will be available at the beginning of each module, so students will have more than a week to work on these reports. These reports test your understanding and synthesis of material in each module, and your ability to extend the underlying concepts and tools in an application area of your choice.\nProject Presentation: Students will present their projects to the class at the end of the term. Presentations should be no more than 15 minutes long and should be aimed at a general science audience. Each presentation should demonstrate comprehension of technical aspects, clearly communicate limitations and opportunities for future work, and include signposts for peer feedback. Part of your grade on this component consists of the quality of your feedback to your peers on their presentations (more on this in the relevant assignment).\nWritten Project Report: Students will synthesize their term-long progress reports and feedback from their project presentation into a detailed proposal for how to implement the planned decision analysis.\n\nThese components are each worth 20% of your overall grade. The course project is broken into complimentary components to help keep you on track over the term and to lower the stakes of the overall project.\nAssignments must be submitted via Canvas by the deadline to receive a full grade. Late submissions will receive a downgrading by 25% of the full credit for each day they are late. Submissions after the end of the examination period do not receive any points. Each partial day will be rounded up. You may want to submit a few hours before the deadline to avoid last minute technical problems. Extension requests must be made via email 24 hours before the submission deadline with a submission of what has been achieved, thus far.",

    "text": "Class Policies\n\nCanvas\nCourse communication, assignments, submissions of written materials will be handled through the course Canvas site. Recordings will be made for most sessions (i.e., not several active learning sessions on Wednesdays) and posted on Canvas.\n\n\nAcademic Honor Principle\nStudents are expected to follow Dartmouth’s Academic Honor Principle and Thayer’s Academic Honor Policy.\n\n\nReligious Observances\nDartmouth has a deep commitment to support students’ religious observances and diverse faith practices. Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me as soon as possible — before the end of the second week of the term at the latest — to discuss appropriate course adjustments.\n\n\nStudent Accessibility and Accommodations\nStudents requesting disability-related accommodations and services for this course are required to register with Student Accessibility Services (SAS; Apply for Services webpage; student.accessibility.services@dartmouth.edu; 1-603-646-9900) and to request that an accommodation email be sent to me in advance of the need for an accommodation. Then, students should schedule a follow-up meeting with me to determine relevant details such as what role SAS or its Testing Center may play in accommodation implementation. This process works best for everyone when completed as early in the quarter as possible. If students have questions about whether they are eligible for accommodations or have concerns about the implementation of their accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.\n\n\nClass Climate and Inclusivity\nWe will discuss topics that for some are associated with strong emotions and opinions. We will read and discuss sources from a wide range of authors. These sources are selected to sample a wide range of diverse perspectives. However, it seems likely that important perspectives are missing.\nThis class strives to provide a respectful, inclusive, and civil space for all. Please inform all members of this class if your names and pronouns you prefer differ from your official record. Please reach out to the instructor if your performance and ability to learn is impacted by factors outside of the classroom (including financial challenges). The instructor is here to help as much as possible. Feedback can also be anonymous (including a note under the office door of the instructor). We all are continuously learning about how to ensure an inclusive environment and how to discuss contentious and emotional subjects. Please provide feedback if something makes you feel uncomfortable.\n\n\nUse of GenAI\nWork submitted for a grade in this course must reflect your own understanding. The use and consultation of AI/ML tools, such as ChatGPT or similar, for any purpose whatsoever, must be pre-approved and clearly referenced. Please see Dartmouth’s Guidelines on using GenAI.\nMy general view is that Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools that you will encounter and use when you leave this classroom, so it’s important to learn how to use them responsibly and effectively. However, these are difficult skills to teach and are not the focus of this course. I will likely not accept requests to use GenAI to generate text for writing assignments. However, I may accept requests to use LLMs to support coding tasks. This can help accelerate your workflow, especially when you are less familiar with a new language. However, LLMs can end up being a less productive use of your time than talking to colleagues, checking out documentation and APIs, looking at StackOverflow, and experimenting with trial and failure. You are responsible for understanding and debugging your code, and for ensuring that it does what you intend it to do.\nIf approved, you must:\n\nreference the URL of the service you are using, including the specific date you accessed it;\nprovide the exact query or queries used to interact with the tool; and\nreport the exact response received.\n\n\n\nStudent’s Consent\nBy enrolling in this course:\n\nI affirm my understanding that the instructor may record meetings of this course and any associated meetings open to multiple students and the instructor, including but not limited to scheduled and ad hoc office hours and other consultations, within any digital platform, including those used to offer remote instruction for this course.\nI further affirm that the instructor owns the copyright to their instructional materials, of which these recordings constitute a part, and my distribution of any of these recordings in whole or in part to any person or entity other than other members of the class without prior written consent of the instructor may be subject to discipline by Dartmouth up to and including separation from Dartmouth.\nRequirement of consent to one-on-one recordings By enrolling in this course, I hereby affirm that I will not make a recording in any medium of any one-on-one meeting with the instructor or another member of the class or group of members of the class without obtaining the prior written consent of all those participating, and I understand that if I violate this prohibition, I will be subject to discipline by Dartmouth up to and including separation from Dartmouth, as well as any other civil or criminal penalties under applicable law. I understand that an exception to this consent applies to accommodations approved by SAS for a student’s disability, and that one or more students in a class may record class lectures, discussions, lab sessions, and review sessions and take pictures of essential information, and/or be provided class notes for personal study use only.\n\nIf you have questions, please contact the Office of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.\n\n\nMental Health and Wellbeing\nThe academic environment is challenging, our terms are intensive, and classes are not the only demanding part of your life. There are a number of resources available to you on campus to support your wellness, including: the Counseling Center, which allows you to book triage appointments online, the Student Wellness Center which offers wellness check-ins, and your undergraduate dean. The student-led Dartmouth Student Mental Health Union and their peer support program may be helpful if you would like to speak to a trained fellow student support listener. If you need immediate assistance, please contact the counselor on-call at (603) 646-9442 at any time. Please make me aware of anything that will hinder your success in this course.\n\n\nTitle IX\nAt Dartmouth, we value integrity, responsibility, and respect for the rights and interests of others, all central to our Principles of Community. We are dedicated to establishing and maintaining a safe and inclusive campus where all community members have equal access to Dartmouth’s educational and employment opportunities. We strive to promote an environment of sexual respect, safety, and well-being. Through the Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy (SMP), Dartmouth demonstrates that sex and gender-based discrimination, sex and gender-based harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, etc., are not tolerated in our community. For more information regarding Title IX and to access helpful resources, visit Title IX’s website. As a faculty member, I am required to share disclosures of sexual or gender-based misconduct with the Title IX office. If you have any questions or want to explore support and assistance, please contact the Title IX office at 603-646-0922 or TitleIX@dartmouth.edu. Speaking to Title IX does not automatically initiate a college resolution. Instead, much of their work is around providing supportive measures to ensure you can continue to engage in Dartmouth’s programs and activities.",
