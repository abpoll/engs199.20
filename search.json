    "text": "Grading\nLabs will be graded on a scale of 0-5:\n\nMissing (0/5): Lab solution is missing or is not responsive to the lab prompt(s);\nNeeds Improvement (1/5): Lab is largely incomplete or is missing key concepts;\nAcceptable (2/5): Lab is mostly complete but may contain major conceptual or implementation errors and writing has substantial room for growth;\nDecent (3/5): Lab is mostly or fully complete without any major errors, but there are some minor errors and the writing/report presentation has room for growth.\nGood (4/5): Lab is fully complete without any major errors, but there are some minor errors or the writing/report presentation has room for growth.\nStrong (5/5): Lab is fully complete without any errors and the writing/report presentation is clear.\n\nNo late submissions will be graded. However, I will provide feedback on all lab reports, even if late. Your lowest lab report grade will be dropped.\n\nHow to get a 5/5 on lab\n\nGet the “right” answer for the “right” reason.\n\nBad work can accidentally lead to poor decisions (and strong analysis may not identify good decisions). It is crucial that you show your work in a traceable and understandable way so that decision-makers understand why your analysis supports certain decisions. I will grade your work for how well it demonstrates why and how you get the right answers. Because most of your code for lab report is provided with lab instructions, this mostly entails accurate references to source material (i.e., readings and code blocks/instructions from lab). However, you will be responsible for processing/presenting/interpreting results generated with lab instructions. Think about the following things when answering lab report questions:\n\nSpecific references to modeling results, figures, references, code blocks, etc., make it easier to demonstrate you got the right answer for the right reason.\nThe cleaner and clearer your code and documentation in your Jupyter notebook, the more likely I can check for correctness.\n\n\nBe as clear as possible.\n\nDecision-makers cannot read your mind. Ambiguity in decision analysis is bad decision support. Submissions that are unclear for any reason, including but not limited to unclear syntax (writing or code), lack of reasoning to support synthesis, or too much detail in writing will not be strong.\n\nThis includes being transparent about values-laden assumptions and limitations, as well as providing careful synthesis that demonstrates understanding and genuine insights.\n\n\nA good figure is worth 1,000 words\n\nVisualizations are the main way to convey results and insights to decision-mamkers. Figures should be correct and highly legible. You must:\n\nChoose the appropriate axes and label them accordingly;\nPlot the correct data series;\nInclude a descriptive legend (if it applies);\nProvide a succint descriptive caption (do not report or interpret results in a caption).\n\n\nTake your time\n\nIt is difficult to meet guidelines 1-3 in one pass. For example, on guideline 2, I tend to revise each draft of scientific manuscripts 3-4 times before sharing with co-authors, a cycle that repeats several times each paper. As another example, on guideline 3, I tend to spend at least one week working on a single figure for scientific manuscripts. This course expects you to spend roughly 3 times the in-person hours outside of course, which equates to ~10 hours. This time corresponds to one required reading, polishing your lab report (1-2 of the in-person hours each week are lab work in a class setting), and cumulatively connecting new concepts to your course project. These activities are highly synergistic, and time you spend on lab reports will pay off big for your project progress reports. Labs are also your main opportunity in the class to demonstrate to an outside audience, through your GitHub page, your decision analysis and science communication skills.",

These wicked problems (Rittel & Webber, 1973), such as addressing climate risks, can’t be solved with standard engineering methods because they involve multiple stakeholders with competing goals, uncertainties that evolve over time, and complex system behaviors we’re still trying to understand. Decision-makers need new tools and frameworks that can handle this complexity while still pointing the way toward practical action. In this course, students will learn about state-of-the-art technical methods that offer promise for meeting decision-making needs to respond to climate risks. Topics range from complex systems analysis to reinforcement learning, and multi-objective robust decision-making.\n\nRittel, H. W. J., & Webber, M. M. (1973).

Students are expected to:\n\ncome prepared to class (e.g., by carefully reading and synthesizing the reading assignments before class and being ready to present their synthesis in class);\nactively contribute to the group discussions and activities;\nsubmit the assignments on time; and\nattend office hours as needed.\n\nStudents should expect to spend roughly three times the in-course hours outside the classroom for readings and assignments.\n\nCommunication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, Be Excellent To Teach Other\n\n\n\nWe all make mistakes in our communications with one another, both when speaking and listening. Be mindful of how spoken or written language might be misunderstood, and be aware that, for a variety of reasons, how others perceive your words and actions may not be exactly how you intended them. At the same time, it is also essential that we be respectful and interpret each other’s comments and actions in good faith.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting Tips\n\n\n\n\nDo not take screenshots of code. I will not respond. Screenshots can be difficult to read and limit accessibility. Put your code on GitHub, share the link, and point to specific line numbers if relevant, or provide a simple, self-contained example of the problem you’re running into.\nIf you wait until the day an assignment is due (or even late the previous night) to ask a question on Canvas, there is a strong chance that I will not see your post prior to the deadline.\nIf you see unanswered questions and you have some insight, please answer!

    "text": "Assessments\n\nActive Participation: 10%\nCollaboration and collegiality are important skills for interdisciplinary decision analysts. We will practice these skills in the following ways:\n\nAsking questions during course meetings and/or office hours;\nParticipating in serious games and group discussions;\nProviding constructive feedback on student-led presentations;\nCollaborating on computational labs and managing a shared GitHub repository.\n\nGraduate students will additionally practice these skills by leading a journal club session on one of the assigned readings.\nNote that passively attending class will not yield full participation points. Participation points are not free. I will record lectures, student-led presentations and group discussions, and lab tutorials and post them to Canvas. It is possible to attend these sessions remotely on Zoom, but this can affect your ability to actively participate. It is not possible to attend some of the Wednesday active learning sessions remotely and these will not be recorded.\n\n\nComputational Labs: 30%\nWe will use class time for hands-on programming exercises to give you guided practice applying the concepts and methods from class. These labs will be done in groups; if you cannot bring a laptop to class, you will be able to (and are encouraged to) work with other students, though you must turn in your own lab report for grading. All labs will cover either a set of programming tools or a case study, such as reproducing analyses in peer-reviewed studies (e.g., https://github.com/abpoll/j40_gc/tree/v1.0.0-pub and https://github.com/jdossgollin/2022-elevation-robustness).\nLab reports are due before the following lab.\n\n\nCourse Project: 60%\nThe goal of the course project is to develop and report on an actionable plan for implementing a quantitative decision analysis for the student’s topic of choice. This project can be highly synergistic with thesis projects and students are encouraged to choose a decision problem related to their thesis if they are working on one.\nStudents will work on this project throughout the entire term, with ongoing evaluations and three major evaluation milestones as follows:\n\nProject Progress Reports: At the end of each course module, students will have one week to submit a progress report that details a technically appropriate plan to integrate methods covered in the module in a quantitative decision analysis. A list of guiding questions will be available at the beginning of each module, so students will have more than a week to work on these reports. These reports test your understanding and synthesis of material in each module, and your ability to extend the underlying concepts and tools in an application area of your choice.\nProject Presentation: Students will present their projects to the class at the end of the term. Presentations should be no more than 15 minutes long and should be aimed at a general science audience. Each presentation should demonstrate comprehension of technical aspects, clearly communicate limitations and opportunities for future work, and include signposts for peer feedback. Part of your grade on this component consists of the quality of your feedback to your peers on their practice presentations (more on this in the relevant assignment).\nWritten Project Report: Students will synthesize their term-long progress reports and feedback from their project presentation into a detailed proposal for how to implement the planned decision analysis.\n\nThese components are each worth 20% of your overall grade. The course project is broken into complimentary components to help keep you on track over the term and to lower the stakes of the overall project.\nAssignments must be submitted via Canvas by the deadline to receive a full grade. Late submissions will receive a downgrading by 25% of the full credit for each day they are late. Submissions after the end of the examination period do not receive any points. Each partial day will be rounded up. You may want to submit a few hours before the deadline to avoid last minute technical problems. Extension requests must be made via email 24 hours before the submission deadline with a submission of what has been achieved, thus far.",

Recordings will be made for most sessions (i.e., not several active learning sessions on Wednesdays) and posted on Canvas.\n\n\nAcademic Honor Principle\nStudents are expected to follow Dartmouth’s Academic Honor Principle and Thayer’s Academic Honor Policy.\n\n\nReligious Observances\nDartmouth has a deep commitment to support students’ religious observances and diverse faith practices. Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me as soon as possible — before the end of the second week of the term at the latest — to discuss appropriate course adjustments.\n\n\nStudent Accessibility and Accommodations\nStudents requesting disability-related accommodations and services for this course are required to register with Student Accessibility Services (SAS; Apply for Services webpage; student.accessibility.services@dartmouth.edu; 1-603-646-9900) and to request that an accommodation email be sent to me in advance of the need for an accommodation. Then, students should schedule a follow-up meeting with me to determine relevant details such as what role SAS or its Testing Center may play in accommodation implementation. This process works best for everyone when completed as early in the quarter as possible. If students have questions about whether they are eligible for accommodations or have concerns about the implementation of their accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.\n\n\nClass Climate and Inclusivity\nWe will discuss topics that for some are associated with strong emotions and opinions. We will read and discuss sources from a wide range of authors. These sources are selected to sample a wide range of diverse perspectives. However, it seems likely that important perspectives are missing.\nThis class strives to provide a respectful, inclusive, and civil space for all. Please inform all members of this class if your names and pronouns you prefer differ from your official record. Please reach out to the instructor if your performance and ability to learn is impacted by factors outside of the classroom (including financial challenges). The instructor is here to help as much as possible. Feedback can also be anonymous (including a note under the office door of the instructor). We all are continuously learning about how to ensure an inclusive environment and how to discuss contentious and emotional subjects. Please provide feedback if something makes you feel uncomfortable.\n\n\nUse of GenAI\nWork submitted for a grade in this course must reflect your own understanding. The use and consultation of AI/ML tools, such as ChatGPT or similar, for any purpose whatsoever, must be pre-approved and clearly referenced. Please see Dartmouth’s Guidelines on using GenAI.\nMy general view is that Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools that you will encounter and use when you leave this classroom, so it’s important to learn how to use them responsibly and effectively. However, these are difficult skills to teach and are not the focus of this course. I will likely not accept requests to use GenAI to generate text for writing assignments. However, I may accept requests to use LLMs to support coding tasks. This can help accelerate your workflow, especially when you are less familiar with a new language. However, LLMs can end up being a less productive use of your time than talking to colleagues, checking out documentation and APIs, looking at StackOverflow, and experimenting with trial and failure. You are responsible for understanding and debugging your code, and for ensuring that it does what you intend it to do.\nIf approved, you must:\n\nreference the URL of the service you are using, including the specific date you accessed it;\nprovide the exact query or queries used to interact with the tool; and\nreport the exact response received.\n\n\n\nStudent’s Consent\nBy enrolling in this course:\n\nI affirm my understanding that the instructor may record meetings of this course and any associated meetings open to multiple students and the instructor, including but not limited to scheduled and ad hoc office hours and other consultations, within any digital platform, including those used to offer remote instruction for this course.\nI further affirm that the instructor owns the copyright to their instructional materials, of which these recordings constitute a part, and my distribution of any of these recordings in whole or in part to any person or entity other than other members of the class without prior written consent of the instructor may be subject to discipline by Dartmouth up to and including separation from Dartmouth.\nRequirement of consent to one-on-one recordings By enrolling in this course, I hereby affirm that I will not make a recording in any medium of any one-on-one meeting with the instructor or another member of the class or group of members of the class without obtaining the prior written consent of all those participating, and I understand that if I violate this prohibition, I will be subject to discipline by Dartmouth up to and including separation from Dartmouth, as well as any other civil or criminal penalties under applicable law. I understand that an exception to this consent applies to accommodations approved by SAS for a student’s disability, and that one or more students in a class may record class lectures, discussions, lab sessions, and review sessions and take pictures of essential information, and/or be provided class notes for personal study use only.\n\nIf you have questions, please contact the Office of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.\n\n\nMental Health and Wellbeing\nThe academic environment is challenging, our terms are intensive, and classes are not the only demanding part of your life. There are a number of resources available to you on campus to support your wellness, including: the Counseling Center, which allows you to book triage appointments online, the Student Wellness Center which offers wellness check-ins, and your undergraduate dean. The student-led Dartmouth Student Mental Health Union and their peer support program may be helpful if you would like to speak to a trained fellow student support listener. If you need immediate assistance, please contact the counselor on-call at (603) 646-9442 at any time. Please make me aware of anything that will hinder your success in this course.\n\n\nTitle IX\nAt Dartmouth, we value integrity, responsibility, and respect for the rights and interests of others, all central to our Principles of Community. We are dedicated to establishing and maintaining a safe and inclusive campus where all community members have equal access to Dartmouth’s educational and employment opportunities. We strive to promote an environment of sexual respect, safety, and well-being. Through the Sexual and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy (SMP), Dartmouth demonstrates that sex and gender-based discrimination, sex and gender-based harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, etc., are not tolerated in our community. For more information regarding Title IX and to access helpful resources, visit Title IX’s website. As a faculty member, I am required to share disclosures of sexual or gender-based misconduct with the Title IX office. If you have any questions or want to explore support and assistance, please contact the Title IX office at 603-646-0922 or TitleIX@dartmouth.edu. Speaking to Title IX does not automatically initiate a college resolution. Instead, much of their work is around providing supportive measures to ensure you can continue to engage in Dartmouth’s programs and activities.",
