  abstract = "Models of complex systems can capture much useful information but
              can be difficult to apply to real-world decision-making because
              the type of information they contain is often inconsistent with
              that required for traditional decision analysis. New approaches,
              which use inductive reasoning over large ensembles of
              computational experiments, now make possible systematic comparison
              of alternative policy options using models of complex systems.
              This article describes Computer-Assisted Reasoning, an approach to
              decision-making under conditions of deep uncertainty that is
              ideally suited to applying complex systems to policy analysis. The

              climate change, with a particular focus on the role of technology
              policies in a robust, adaptive strategy for greenhouse gas

  abstract  = "AbstractClimate risks are growing. Research is increasingly
               important to inform the design of risk‐management strategies.
               Assessing such strategies necessarily brings values into
               research. But the values assumed within research (often only
               implicitly) may not align with those of stakeholders and decision
               makers. These misalignments are often invisible to researchers
               and can severely limit research relevance or lead to
               inappropriate policy advice. Aligning strategy assessments with
               stakeholders' values requires a holistic approach to research
               design that is oriented around those values from the start.
               Integrating values into research in this way requires
               collaboration with stakeholders, integration across disciplines,
               and attention to all aspects of research design. Here we describe
               and demonstrate a qualitative conceptual tool called a
               values‐informed mental model (ViMM) to support such
               values‐centered research design. ViMMs map stakeholders' values
               onto a conceptual model of a study system to visualize the
               intersection of those values with coupled natural‐human system
               dynamics. Through this mapping, ViMMs integrate inputs from
               diverse collaborators to support the design of research that
               assesses risk‐management strategies in light of stakeholders'
               values. We define a visual language for ViMMs, describe
               accompanying practices and workflows, and present an illustrative
               application to the case of flood‐risk management in a small
               community along the Susquehanna river in the Northeast United
