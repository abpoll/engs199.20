               important to inform the design of risk‐management strategies.
               Assessing such strategies necessarily brings values into
               research. But the values assumed within research (often only
               implicitly) may not align with those of stakeholders and decision
               makers. These misalignments are often invisible to researchers
               and can severely limit research relevance or lead to
               inappropriate policy advice. Aligning strategy assessments with
               stakeholders' values requires a holistic approach to research
               design that is oriented around those values from the start.
               Integrating values into research in this way requires
               collaboration with stakeholders, integration across disciplines,
               and attention to all aspects of research design. Here we describe
               and demonstrate a qualitative conceptual tool called a
               values‐informed mental model (ViMM) to support such
               values‐centered research design. ViMMs map stakeholders' values

               assesses risk‐management strategies in light of stakeholders'
               values. We define a visual language for ViMMs, describe

              managing these flood risks present decision challenges that
              require a combination of geophysical, economic, and infrastructure
              models. Previous studies have broken important new ground on the
              considerable tensions between the costs of upgrading
              infrastructure and the damages that could result from extreme
              flood events. However, many risk-based adaptation strategies
              remain silent on certain potentially important uncertainties, as
              well as the tradeoffs between competing objectives. Here, we
              implement and improve on a classic decision-analytical model (Van
              Dantzig 1956) to: (i) capture tradeoffs across conflicting
              stakeholder objectives, (ii) demonstrate the consequences of
              structural uncertainties in the sea-level rise and storm surge
              models, and (iii) identify the parametric uncertainties that most
              strongly influence each objective using global sensitivity
              analysis. We find that the flood adaptation model produces
              potentially myopic solutions when formulated using traditional
              mean-centric decision theory. Moving from a single-objective
              problem formulation to one with multiobjective tradeoffs
              dramatically expands the decision space, and highlights the need
              for compromise solutions to address stakeholder preferences. We
              find deep structural uncertainties that have large effects on the
              model outcome, with the storm surge parameters accounting for the
              greatest impacts. Global sensitivity analysis effectively
              identifies important parameter interactions that local methods
              overlook, and that could have critical implications for flood

               also subject to numerous uncertainties that prevent the direct
               application of simulation models for prediction and planning,
               particularly when extrapolating past behavior to a nonstationary
               future. Recent studies have developed a combination of methods to
               characterize, attribute, and quantify these uncertainties for
               both single- and multi-sector systems. Here, we review challenges

              Deciding how high to elevate a house poses a nontrivial decision

              recommends elevating existing houses to the Base Flood Elevation
              (the elevation of the 100-year flood) plus a freeboard. This
              recommendation neglects many uncertainties. Here we analyze a

              Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) is a set of

  abstract  = "Abstract Projections of nonstationary climate risks can vary
               considerably from one source to another, posing considerable
               communication and decision-analytical challenges. One such
               challenge is how to present trade-offs under deep uncertainty in
               a salient and interpretable manner. Some common approaches
               include analyzing a small subset of projections or treating all
               considered projections as equally likely. These approaches can
               underestimate risks, hide deep uncertainties, and are mostly
               silent on which assumptions drive decision-relevant outcomes.
               Here we introduce and demonstrate a transparent Bayesian
               framework for synthesizing deep uncertainties to inform climate
               risk management. The first step of this workflow is to generate
               an ensemble of simulations representing possible futures and
               analyze them through standard exploratory modeling techniques.
               Next, a small set of probability distributions representing
               subjective beliefs about the likelihood of possible futures is
               used to weight the scenarios. Finally, these weights are used to
               compute and characterize trade-offs, conduct robustness checks,
               and reveal implicit assumptions. We demonstrate the framework
               through a didactic case study analyzing how high to elevate a
               house to manage coastal flood risks.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Planning under deep uncertainty, when probabilistic
               characterizations of the future are unknown, is a major challenge
               in water resources management. Many planning frameworks advocate
               for ?scenario-neutral? analyses in which alternative policies are
               evaluated over plausible future scenarios with no assessment of
               their likelihoods. Instead, these frameworks use sensitivity
               analysis to discover which uncertain factors have the greatest
               influence on performance. This knowledge can be used to design
               monitoring programs and adaptive policies that respond to changes
               in the critical uncertainties. However, scenario-neutral analyses
               make implicit assumptions about the range and independence of the
               uncertain factors that may not be consistent with the coupled
               human-hydrologic processes influencing the system. These
               assumptions could influence which factors are found to be most
               important and which policies are most robust, belying their
               neutrality; assuming uniformity and independence could have
               decision-relevant implications. This study illustrates these
               implications using a multistakeholder planning problem within the
               Colorado River Basin, where hundreds of rights holders vie for
               the river's limited water under the law of prior appropriation.
               Variance-based sensitivity analyses are performed to assess
               users' vulnerabilities to changing hydrologic conditions using
               four experimental designs: (1) scenario-neutral samples of
               hydrologic factors, centered on recent historical conditions, (2)
               scenarios informed by climate projections, (3) scenarios informed
               by paleohydrologic reconstructions, and (4) scenario-neutral
               samples of hydrologic factors spanning all previous experimental
               designs. Differences in sensitivities and user robustness
               rankings across the experiments illustrate the challenges of
               inferring the most consequential drivers of vulnerabilities to
               design effective monitoring programs and robust management
               policies.",
