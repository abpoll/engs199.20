               important to inform the design of risk‐management strategies.
               Assessing such strategies necessarily brings values into
               research. But the values assumed within research (often only
               implicitly) may not align with those of stakeholders and decision
               makers. These misalignments are often invisible to researchers
               and can severely limit research relevance or lead to
               inappropriate policy advice. Aligning strategy assessments with
               stakeholders' values requires a holistic approach to research
               design that is oriented around those values from the start.
               Integrating values into research in this way requires
               collaboration with stakeholders, integration across disciplines,
               and attention to all aspects of research design. Here we describe
               and demonstrate a qualitative conceptual tool called a
               values‐informed mental model (ViMM) to support such
               values‐centered research design. ViMMs map stakeholders' values

               values. We define a visual language for ViMMs, describe

              managing these flood risks present decision challenges that
              require a combination of geophysical, economic, and infrastructure
              models. Previous studies have broken important new ground on the
              considerable tensions between the costs of upgrading
              infrastructure and the damages that could result from extreme
              flood events. However, many risk-based adaptation strategies
              remain silent on certain potentially important uncertainties, as
              well as the tradeoffs between competing objectives. Here, we
              implement and improve on a classic decision-analytical model (Van
              Dantzig 1956) to: (i) capture tradeoffs across conflicting
              stakeholder objectives, (ii) demonstrate the consequences of
              structural uncertainties in the sea-level rise and storm surge
              models, and (iii) identify the parametric uncertainties that most
              strongly influence each objective using global sensitivity
              analysis. We find that the flood adaptation model produces
              potentially myopic solutions when formulated using traditional
              mean-centric decision theory. Moving from a single-objective
              problem formulation to one with multiobjective tradeoffs
              dramatically expands the decision space, and highlights the need
              for compromise solutions to address stakeholder preferences. We
              find deep structural uncertainties that have large effects on the
              model outcome, with the storm surge parameters accounting for the
              greatest impacts. Global sensitivity analysis effectively
              identifies important parameter interactions that local methods
              overlook, and that could have critical implications for flood

               also subject to numerous uncertainties that prevent the direct
               application of simulation models for prediction and planning,
               particularly when extrapolating past behavior to a nonstationary

               characterize, attribute, and quantify these uncertainties for
               both single- and multi-sector systems. Here, we review challenges

              Deciding how high to elevate a house poses a nontrivial decision

              recommends elevating existing houses to the Base Flood Elevation
              (the elevation of the 100-year flood) plus a freeboard. This
              recommendation neglects many uncertainties. Here we analyze a

              Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) is a set of

  abstract  = "Abstract Projections of nonstationary climate risks can vary
               considerably from one source to another, posing considerable
               communication and decision-analytical challenges. One such
               challenge is how to present trade-offs under deep uncertainty in
               a salient and interpretable manner. Some common approaches
               include analyzing a small subset of projections or treating all
               considered projections as equally likely. These approaches can
               underestimate risks, hide deep uncertainties, and are mostly
               silent on which assumptions drive decision-relevant outcomes.
               Here we introduce and demonstrate a transparent Bayesian
               framework for synthesizing deep uncertainties to inform climate
               risk management. The first step of this workflow is to generate
               an ensemble of simulations representing possible futures and
               analyze them through standard exploratory modeling techniques.
               Next, a small set of probability distributions representing
               subjective beliefs about the likelihood of possible futures is
               used to weight the scenarios. Finally, these weights are used to
               compute and characterize trade-offs, conduct robustness checks,
               and reveal implicit assumptions. We demonstrate the framework
               through a didactic case study analyzing how high to elevate a
               house to manage coastal flood risks.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Planning under deep uncertainty, when probabilistic
               characterizations of the future are unknown, is a major challenge
               in water resources management. Many planning frameworks advocate
               for ?scenario-neutral? analyses in which alternative policies are
               evaluated over plausible future scenarios with no assessment of
               their likelihoods. Instead, these frameworks use sensitivity
               analysis to discover which uncertain factors have the greatest
               influence on performance. This knowledge can be used to design
               monitoring programs and adaptive policies that respond to changes
               in the critical uncertainties. However, scenario-neutral analyses
               make implicit assumptions about the range and independence of the
               uncertain factors that may not be consistent with the coupled
               human-hydrologic processes influencing the system. These
               assumptions could influence which factors are found to be most
               important and which policies are most robust, belying their
               neutrality; assuming uniformity and independence could have
               decision-relevant implications. This study illustrates these
               implications using a multistakeholder planning problem within the
               Colorado River Basin, where hundreds of rights holders vie for
               the river's limited water under the law of prior appropriation.
               Variance-based sensitivity analyses are performed to assess
               users' vulnerabilities to changing hydrologic conditions using
               four experimental designs: (1) scenario-neutral samples of
               hydrologic factors, centered on recent historical conditions, (2)
               scenarios informed by climate projections, (3) scenarios informed
               by paleohydrologic reconstructions, and (4) scenario-neutral
               samples of hydrologic factors spanning all previous experimental
               designs. Differences in sensitivities and user robustness
               rankings across the experiments illustrate the challenges of
               inferring the most consequential drivers of vulnerabilities to
               design effective monitoring programs and robust management

               analysis approaches to better manage systems with deeply
               uncertain, poorly characterized risks. Most notably, policy
               challenges such as abrupt climate change involve potential
               nonlinear or threshold responses where both the triggering level
               and subsequent system response are poorly understood. This study
               uses a simple computer simulation model to compare several
               alternative frameworks for decision making under uncertainty --
               optimal expected utility, the precautionary principle, and three
               different approaches to robust decision making -- for addressing
               the challenge of adding pollution to a lake without triggering
               unwanted and potentially irreversible eutrophication. The three
               robust decision approaches -- trading some optimal performance
               for less sensitivity to assumptions, satisficing over a wide
               range of futures, and keeping options open -- are found to
               identify similar strategies as the most robust choice. This study
               also suggests that these robust decision approaches offer a

               spirit of the precautionary principle while addressing some of
               its shortcomings. Finally, this study finds that robust
               strategies may be preferable to optimum strategies when the

              different moral principles drawn from theories of distributive
              justice to evaluate fairness. We use adaptation planning in
              Vietnam Mekong Delta as a case study. We evaluate the preference

              principle yields distinctive preference rankings, though most
              principles identify the same policy as the most preferred one.
              Across the ensemble of scenarios, the commonly used utilitarian
              principle yields the most stable ranking, while rankings from
              other principles are more sensitive to uncertainty. The
              sufficientarian and the envy-free principles yield the most
              distinctive ranking of policies, with a median ranking correlation
              of only 0.07 across all scenarios. Finally, we identify scenarios

              Such frameworks are seldom informative about the geographical
              distribution of risk, raising questions on the fairness of the
              proposed policies. In the present work, we propose a new decision
              criterion that accounts for the distribution of risk reduction and
              apply it to support flood risk management decisions on a
              transboundary stretch of the Rhine River. Three types of
              interventions are considered: embankment heightening, making Room
              for the River, and changing the discharge distribution of the
              river branches. The analysis involves solving a flood risk
              management problem according to four alternative formulations,
              based on different ethical principles. Formulations based on cost
              optimization lead to very poor performances in some areas for the
              sake of reducing the overall aggregated costs. Formulations that
              also include equity criteria have different results depending on
              how these are defined. When risk reduction is distributed equally,
              very poor economic performance is achieved. When risk is
              distributed equally, results are in line with formulations based
              on cost optimization, while a fairer risk distribution is
              achieved. Risk reduction measures also differ, with the cost
              optimization approach strongly favoring the leverage of changing
              the discharge distribution and the alternative formulations
              spending more on embankment heightening and Room for the River, to
              rebalance inequalities in risk levels. The proposed method
              advances risk-based decision-making by allowing to consider risk

              (MORDM), called OpenMORDM. OpenMORDM contains two complementary
              components: (1) a software application programming interface (API)
              for connecting planning models to computational exploration tools
              for many-objective optimization and sensitivity-based discovery of
              critical deeply uncertain factors; and (2) a web-based
              visualization toolkit for exploring high-dimensional datasets to
              better understand system trade-offs, vulnerabilities, and
              dependencies. We demonstrate the OpenMORDM framework on a
              challenging environmental management test case termed the “lake
              problem”. The lake problem has been used extensively in the prior
              environmental decision science literature and, in this study,
              captures the challenges posed by conflicting economic and
              environmental objectives, a water quality “tipping point” beyond
              which the lake may become irreversibly polluted, and multiple
              deeply uncertain factors that may undermine the robustness of
              pollution management policies. The OpenMORDM software framework
              enables decision makers to identify policy-relevant scenarios,
              quantify the trade-offs between alternative strategies in
              different scenarios, flexibly explore alternative definitions of
              robustness, and identify key system factors that should be
              monitored as triggers for future actions or additional planning.
              The web-based OpenMORDM visualization toolkit allows decision

              option for analysts to extend the framework with customized

               decisions demand approaches that can explicitly acknowledge and
               evaluate diverse trade-offs. We identified a diversity of
               apparent trade-offs in a small-scale tropical fishery when
               ecological simulations were integrated with participatory
               assessments of social-ecological system structure and
               stakeholders' well-being. Despite an apparent win-win between
               conservation and profitability at the aggregate scale, food
               production, employment, and well-being of marginalized
               stakeholders were differentially influenced by management
               decisions leading to trade-offs. Some of these trade-offs were
               suggested to be ``taboo'' trade-offs between morally
               incommensurable values, such as between profits and the
               well-being of marginalized women. These were not previously
               recognized as management issues. Stakeholders explored and
               deliberated over trade-offs supported by an interactive ``toy
               model'' representing key system trade-offs, alongside qualitative
               narrative scenarios of the future. The concept of taboo
               trade-offs suggests that psychological bias and social
               sensitivity may exclude key issues from decision making, which
               can result in policies that are difficult to implement. Our
               participatory modeling and scenarios approach has the potential
               to increase awareness of such trade-offs, promote discussion of
               what is acceptable, and potentially identify and reduce obstacles
               to management compliance.",

               recent studies aim to identify policies mapping future
               observations to actions?in other words, framing climate
               adaptation as an optimal control problem. This paper uses the
               control paradigm to review and classify recent dynamic planning
               studies according to their approaches to uncertainty
               characterization, policy structure, and solution methods. We
               propose a set of research gaps and opportunities in this area
               centered on the challenge of characterizing uncertainty, which
               prevents the unambiguous application of control methods to this
               problem. These include exogenous uncertainty in forcing, model
               structure, and parameters propagated through a chain of climate
               and hydrologic models; endogenous uncertainty in
               human-environmental system dynamics across multiple scales; and
               sampling uncertainty due to the finite length of historical
               observations and future projections. Recognizing these

  abstract  = "AbstractThe challenge of adapting water resources systems to
               uncertain hydroclimatic and socioeconomic conditions warrants a
               dynamic planning approach. Recent studies have designed policies
               with structures linking infrastructure and management actions to
               threshold values of indicator variables observed over time.
               Typically, one or more of these components are held fixed while
               the others are optimized, constraining the flexibility of policy
               generation. Here we develop a framework to address this challenge
               by designing and testing dynamic adaptation policies that combine
               indicators, actions, and thresholds in a flexible structure. The
               approach is demonstrated for a case study of northern California,
               where a mix of infrastructure, management, and operational
               adaptations are considered over time in response to an ensemble
               of nonstationary hydrology and water demands. We first identify a
               subset of non‐dominated policies that are robust to held‐out
               scenarios, and then analyze their most common actions and
               indicators compared to non‐robust policies. Results show that the
               robust policies are not differentiated by the actions they
               select, but show substantial differences in their indicator
               variables, which can be interpreted in the context of physical
               hydrologic trends. In particular, the most frequent statistical
               transformations of indicator variables highlight the balance
               between adapting quickly versus correctly. Additionally, we
               determine the indicators most frequently associated with each
               action, as well as the distribution of action timing across
               scenarios. This study presents a new and transferable problem
               framing for adaptation under uncertainty in which indicator
               variables, actions, and policy structure are identified
               simultaneously during the optimization.",

               identified based on aggregate robustness measures that do not
               take full advantage of the richness of the underlying dynamics in
               the large ensembles of model simulations and can make it hard to
               identify key dynamics and/or storylines that can guide planning
               or further analyses. This study introduces the FRamework for
               Narrative Storylines and Impact Classification (FRNSIC;
               pronounced “forensic”): a scenario discovery framework that
               addresses these challenges by organizing and investigating
               consequential scenarios using hierarchical classification of
               diverse outcomes across actors, sectors, and scales, while also
               aiding in the selection of scenario storylines, based on system
               dynamics that drive consequential outcomes. We present an
               application of this framework to the Upper Colorado River Basin,
               focusing on decadal droughts and their water scarcity
               implications for the basin's diverse users and its obligations to
               downstream states through Lake Powell. We show how FRNSIC can
               explore alternative sets of impact metrics and drought dynamics
               and use them to identify drought scenario storylines, that can be
               used to inform future adaptation planning.",

               that we call scenario discovery, which aims to address these
               challenges. The approach defines scenarios as a set of plausible
               future states of the world that represent vulnerabilities of
               proposed policies, that is, cases where a policy fails to meet
               its performance goals. Scenario discovery characterizes such sets
               by helping users to apply statistical or data-mining algorithms
               to databases of simulation-model-generated results in order to
               identify easy-to-interpret combinations of uncertain model input
               parameters that are highly predictive of these policy-relevant
               cases. The approach has already proved successful in several high

               also brings new challenges to water supply planning. Successful

               multiple partners while navigating power relationships between
               regional actors. In long‐term infrastructure planning contexts,
               this challenge is heightened by the evolving system‐state
               dynamics, which may be fundamentally reshaped by infrastructure
               investment. This work introduces Equitable, Robust, Adaptive, and

               exploratory modeling framework for developing regional water

               partners and explore regional power relationships within

               develop cooperative infrastructure investment pathways in the

               unintended adverse consequences for regional partnerships.
               Results further illustrate that regional and individual
               vulnerabilities are highly interdependent and emphasize the need
               to limit counterparty risks through carefully designed

               can improve the efficiency of resource allocation and delay the
               need for new infrastructure investments. Though cooperation
               provides utilities with the potential for reduced cost strategies
               for improving the reliability of their services, two important
               challenges are worthy of careful consideration. First, regional
               utilities often have to navigate robustness conflicts stemming
               from potential asymmetries in their risk exposure, demand
               dynamics, and the availability of supply resources. Second,
               successful implementation of candidate compromise water
               portfolios requires that cooperating utilities understand their
               operational tolerances to deviations from the recommended
               regional actions (“imperfect implementation”). This study
               contributes a framework for identifying compromises across
               regional robustness conflicts and quantifying tolerances to

               their vulnerabilities to growing demands and hydroclimatic

               compromise management strategies can yield significant and

               robustness can be amplified with modest deviations from their

               applicable to water supply regionalization as a global challenge

               on the Scenario Matrix Framework's abstraction of “challenges to

               flexible discovery of diverse and consequential scenarios. We
               combine visual and statistical techniques for interrogating a
               large factorial data set of 33,750 scenarios generated using the
               Global Change Assessment Model. We demonstrate how the analytic
               framework can aid in identifying which scenario assumptions are
               most tied to user‐specified measures for policy relevant outcomes
               of interest, specifically for our example high or low mitigation
               costs. We show that the current approach for selecting reference
               scenarios can miss policy relevant scenario narratives that often
               emerge as hybrids of optimistic and pessimistic scenario
               assumptions. We also show that the same scenario assumption can
               be associated with both high and low mitigation costs depending

               context. In the illustrative example, we show how agricultural

               analysis applied to a large ensemble of 5,760 model realizations
               generated using the Global Change Analysis Model. Eleven
               energy‐related uncertainties are systematically varied,
               representing national mitigation pledges, institutional factors,
               and techno‐economic parameters, among others. The resulting

               outcomes across a broad sampling of uncertainty. The scale of CO2
               removal globally determines how much the energy system can
               continue to emit, but the relative role of different CO2 removal
               options in meeting decarbonization goals varies across regions.
