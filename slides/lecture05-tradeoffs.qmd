# Decisions often involve trade-offs

## Who has evaluated a decision like this?

# Examples of trade-offs in wicked climate problems

## Robustness vs. cost
Our example from last week:

![Groves et al., 2019. [Robust Decision Making (RDM): Application to Water Planning and Climate Policy.](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-05252-2_7)](../_assets/img/tradeoff_ex.png)

## Robustness vs. "optimality"
Think back to our lab from Friday. Anyone want to explain why this trade-off exists?

::: {.incremental}
* Optimizing for a particular state of the world often produces strategies that are vulnerable to different-looking states of the world
* Similarly, optimizing for robustness will sacrifice optimality within any single state of the world
:::

::: {.fragment}
We'll spend next week talking about analyzing trade-offs and robustness together next week

## Economic vs. ecological
Who can offer examples from their project?

## Efficiency vs. equity

::: {.columns}
::: {.column #vcenter width="40%"}
Note that this represents a *theorized* trade-off between economic efficiency and one conception of equity.

::: {.column #vcenter width="50%"}

## Equity vs. equity

## Other considerations to keep in mind

* How outcomes take shape over time
* The spatial scale of the outcomes
* The distribution of the outcomes
* Secular vs. sacred values
* We may also see win-wins!

# Visualizing trade-offs

## Typically, focus on the Pareto front

![[Nazari et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1002/eng2.12726)](../_assets/img/pareto_front.png)

## N-d objective scatter plot

![[Hadka et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2015.07.014)](../_assets/img/pareto_points.jpg)

## Parllel axis plot
![[Hadka et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2015.07.014)](../_assets/img/parallel_axis.jpg)

## Small multiples {.nostretch}
![[Daw et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1414900112)](../_assets/img/small_multiples.png)

## Practical considerations

* Framing analyses inform which objectives to include (e.g., ViMMs) and trade-offs to present  
* Analysts map transparent trade-offs; aggregation is the normative decision-maker role
* Use multiple visualizations and experiment with new ones

# Upcoming Schedule
## Remainder of week
* Case study on Wednesday
* Tutorial on visualizing tradeoffs on Friday
