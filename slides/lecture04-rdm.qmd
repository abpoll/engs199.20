# Predict-Then-Act vs. Agree-On-Decisions
## The DMDU Argument Against Predict-Then-Act

::: {.columns}

:::{.quote}
wicked problems are not well-bounded, are framed differently by various stakeholders, and are not well-understood until after formulation of a solution. Using predictions to adjudicate such problems skews attention toward the proverbial lamp post, not the true location of the keys to a policy solution.

## Finding robust solutions that "perform well" over a "wide range" of futures

## Measuring robustness {.nostretch}

## Regret: The "cost" of choosing "incorrectly"
Adaptating notation in [Lempert and Collins (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2007.00940.x), the regret of action *a* in state *x* is:

$R_{a}(x) = Max_{a'}[PV(U_{a'}(x))] - PV(U_{a}(x))$, 

the difference between the present value expected utility of the *optimal* action in a considered state of the world and the *considered* action's present value expected utility in that state of the world.   

**Note**: There are many ways to go from an action's regret metric in one state (*i.e.,* $T_{1}$) to evaluating its overall robustness (*i.e.,* $T_{2}$ and $T_{3}$). 

## Satisficing
Following [McPhail et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1002/2017EF000649), this approach "seeks to meet a minimum performance threshold." 

Looking across states (*i.e.,* $T_{2}$ and $T_{3}$), the domain criterion is a common approach (e.g., see [Herman et al., (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0000509)), which analysts often implement as the fraction of states of the world in which the performance threshold is met.

## Iterating with Decision-makers {.nostretch}
Many potential conditions where current strategies insufficient:
