# Test your comprehension

## Summarize the study
Succintly, please :) 

::: {.incremental}
* What is the study about?
* How does it address its research question(s)?
* What does the study find?
* What strengths did you find?
* What weaknesses did you find?
* How will you think about this paper going forward with your decision analysis?
:::

## Optimization concepts
Define the following, and explain how it connects to the study:

::: {.incremental}
* Deeply uncertain tipping point
* Open loop, intertemporal optimization
* Curse of dimensionality
* Direct policy search
* Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms
* Policy inertia
* Hypervolume
* Robustness analysis
* Scenario discovery
:::

## Discuss the study's approach
Answer the following questions:

::: {.incremental}
* How did the authors implement MORDM?
* Which optimization approach converges faster?
* Which optimization approach is "better?" How?
* How robust are any of the "optimal" strategies?
* Are there reasons to prefer DPS beyond the study's results?
