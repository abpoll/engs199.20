# Why analyze decisions? 

## How did you make these decisions?

* Where to go to college?

* Whether/where to go to graduate school?

* What car to buy?

* What house/apartment to buy/rent?

## Wicked planning problems

> The search for scientific bases for confronting problems of social policy is bound to fail, becuase of the nature of these problems. They are “wicked” problems...

> [there are no] “optimal solutions” to social problems unless severe qualifications are imposed first...

# Why analyze actions to manage climate risks?

## Actors throughout society are already planning and making decisions to manage their risks

::: {.incremental}
* International agreements to reduce emissions
* National investments in decarbonization
* Large-scale public infrastructure projects
* Household decisions to relocate or harden
* And don't forget: inaction is a decision

**Are actors making good decisions? Can they do better?**

## In this course, you will learn how to:
::: {.incremental}
1. Frame climate decision problems in a helpful way.
2. Apply multi-objective robust decision-making frameworks to real-world problems using open source software tools.
3. Evaluate trade-offs between competing objectives using appropriate quantitative techniques. 
4. Identify actionable insights for addressing problems characterized by deep uncertainties.
5. Communicate complex technical analyses clearly and effectively.
6. Develop professional-quality deliverables. 
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-note}
We are studying an approach to how decisions *could* be made. We are **not** studying how decisions are made. Closing the gap between these two areas of focus might help make decision analysis more useful. That's the topic of an upcoming Thayer course!

* What decision problem interests you the most?
* What are you looking to get out of this course?
* What is one fun fact about you?

# Course overview and logistics

## Our course is fully online!
* Check out the [website](https://abpoll.github.io/engs199.20)
* Check out the [syllabus](https://abpoll.github.io/engs199.20/syllabus.html)
* Check out the [schedule](https://abpoll.github.io/engs199.20/schedule/schedule.html) 

::: {.callout-note}
Your first (ungraded) assignment is to take a short syllabus quiz on Canvas and confirm that you understand, and agree to abide, by course policies. You will have the opportunity to submit questions about the course and we will discuss these together next Monday. 
:::

## Expectations from students
- come prepared to class (e.g., by carefully reading and synthesizing the reading assignments before class and being ready to present their synthesis in class);
- actively contribute to the group discussions and activities;
- submit the assignments on time; and
- attend office hours as needed.

Students should expect to spend roughly three times the in-course hours outside the classroom for readings and assignments. 

## Assignments and grading
* Active Participation (10%)
* Computational Labs (30%)
* Course Project
  - Progress Reports (20%)
  - Presentation (20%)
  - Report (20%)

## There are seven modules in this course
* "Overview": Overview of decision analysis for wicked climate problems
* "Uncertainty": Uncertainty and Monte Carlo analysis
* "RDM": Robust decision-making
* "Trade-offs": Multiple objectives and navigating trade-offs
* "DMDU":  Decision making under deep uncertainty
* "Gaps": Gaps between decision analysis and decision support
* "Projects":  Student project presentations

## Class structure
Emulating the 2 Spot (MWF 2:00-2:55pm, No Tu X-hr)
Let's discuss how we do the labs for this training

::: {.fragment}
### Mondays
* Lecture
* Take notes and ask questions
* Slides posted by Sunday night (often earlier)
:::

::: {.fragment}
### Wednesdays
* Serious (but fun!) game or student-led journal club
* Be prepared to synthesize lessons into your lab report and project update
* Sometimes we will start longer labs on Wednesday
:::

::: {.fragment}
### Fridays
* Lab
* Make substantial progress together
* Lab report due before next lab
:::

::: {.fragment}
### Other Notes
* Available for meetings by appointment
* We can take labs offline and make them optional - let's discuss
:::

## Communication
* Questions during class is best
* Canvas is great - not as good as in class, but still promotes open discussion (this is not relevant for the training)
* Office hours are great (including when the issue is urgent and/or private)
* Email is ok if issue is urgent and/or private and you can't make office hours

## Overall guidelines
* Collaboration is *highly encouraged* and a skill we will practice in course, but **all work must reflect your own understanding**.
  - See GenAI policy on syllabus
  - Always cite external references
* A rubric will be available for all graded assignments and you can easily find it from the schedule webpage.
* Assume good faith of others and engage in good faith yourself.

::: {.callout-warning}
Decision analysis is values-laden and good decision analysis is explicit about normative assumptions. Please do not outsource the opportunity to learn this vital skill.

# Upcoming Schedule
## This week
### Class 
* Tuesday: computing setup (do on your own if you want to work through labs)
* Wednesday: lecture on framing a decision analysis
* Friday: getting comfortable with our computing setup (no lab report) - let's discuss

### Assignments

  - What decision problem will you focus on this term?
  - See [here](../updates/overview.qmd) for more guidance
  - Due next Friday before lab

## Next week
