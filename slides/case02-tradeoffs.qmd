# Test your comprehension

## Apply concepts on trade-offs
See if you can come up with examples of trade-offs that can occur across: 

::: {.incremental}
* Objectives
* Time scales
* Spatial scales
* Perspectives
* Groups
* Secular values
* Sacred values
* Sacred vs. secular values
:::

## Discuss the study's approach
What role did the following methods play?
::: {.incremental}
* Group discussions
* Model calibration
* Participatory conceptual modeling
* Toy model
* Workshop observation and qualitative interviews

## Discuss results

::: {.incremental}
* What did the conventional profit/conservation analysis suggest?
* How did considering different resource users produce new insights?
* How did considering secular and sacred values produce new insights?
* How did interaction with stakeholders affect their understanding of the management problem?
:::

::: {.fragment}
A stakeholder takeaway that resonated with me: "We sometimes have issues with poor stakeholders because they normally oppose whatever you propose. During the workshop, I actually came to understand why they normally oppose, and when I get a negative answer from them, I now understand why."
:::

## Let's discuss the following claims

::: {.incremental}
* "We propose that assertions of unconditional win-wins in ecosystem management should be scrutinized for losses of marginalized, undervalued, and less obvious stakeholders."
* "To reveal [overlooked] trade-offs, analysis needs to reflect complexities in the biophysical system producing the trade-offs... assessments also need to map out the processes that determine who benefits from ecosystem services"
* "...well-being trade-offs may be overlooked if losers, through poverty or political marginalization, have no voice in decision making"
* "...conflicts can arise if primary stakeholders hold different sacred values than managers and government, or if sacred values are not reflected in the framing of decision making"
* "Explicit consideration of the diversity of values and possible taboos help explain the deeply felt conflicts that can result from ecosystem service trade-offs, and ultimately support improved decision making processes."
:::

## Scrutinizing claims, continued
::: {.incremental}
* "Values can be secularized to frame trade-offs as routine, as with the quantitative, monetary valuation and benefit-cost analyses that dominate ecosystem services assessment... however, this approach hides the incommensurable value conflicts, common in environmental decision making, that need to be deliberated and negotiated"
* "The combination of participatory modeling and scenarios can enhance transparency (through participatory modeling), accountability (through explicitly mapping winners and losers), and relevance (through a focus on peopleâ€™s well-being)... has a greater chance of achieving socially equitable and sustainable decision making."

# Applying concepts to our decision problems

## Your examples
Let's take turns applying some new concepts to our problem framings. 

# Logistics
## Friday
* We'll rate and discuss some trade-off visualizations
* HW3 due (Sunday ok)

## Next week
* Monday: bringing things together with MORDM (guest lecture)
* Wednesday: case study
* Friday: case study and HW 4 due (Sunday ok)
