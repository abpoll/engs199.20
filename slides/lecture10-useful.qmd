# Why do we analyze decisions? 
## Our course objectives
1. Frame climate decision problems in a helpful way.
2. Apply multi-objective robust decision-making frameworks to real-world problems using open source software tools.
3. Evaluate trade-offs between competing objectives using appropriate quantitative techniques. 
4. Identify actionable insights for addressing problems characterized by deep uncertainties.
5. Communicate complex technical analyses clearly and effectively.
6. Develop professional-quality deliverables. 

## What did we learn about framing problems in a "helpful" way?
A few guiding questions:

* Did we learn how to inform decisions?  
* Is it possible to do this without co-production? How?
* What frameworks did we learn for providing decision support? 
* Does the DMDU book have a chapter on decision making or support? 

# Perspectives on informing decisions
## Usable information {.nostretch}
![[Lemos et al., (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate1614)](../_assets/img/usable.png){width=550}

## Organizational constraints

> "It's David and Goliath and David ain't winning...the rules and regulations promulgated by those organizations [state and federal entities] make it almost impossible to do mitigation" - Interviewee#15

> "We've got mountiain lions... wolves... coyotes... fishers, great horned owls... eagles. You name it, it's all here... Environmenta impact seems foolish in a town that's all woods" - Interviewee#4

> "We don't want to have a negative impact on the environment but... saving two or three fish is not worth $450,000" - Interviewee#15

> "[federal funding programs are] a great idea but too complex for us to access" - Interviewee#7

## Evaluation
![[Leskens et al., (2014). Why are decisions in flood disaster management so poorly supported by information from flood models?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364815213002843)](../_assets/img/decision_useful.png)

## Knowledge infrastructure
Remember this?

![[Herman et al., (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025502)](../_assets/img/herman_policy.jpg)

## Knowledge infrastructure

Control problem framing abstracts away from who is the "controller"

![[Anderies et al., (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802885115)](../_assets/img/simple_closed.jpeg)

## Knowledge infrastructure
The real-world problem is more complex *and* gets addressed by real-world decision-making processes

![[Deslatte et al., (2024)](https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-15454-290428)](../_assets/img/knowledge_inf.jpg)

## Value of information
Should we expend resources to build new knowledge? Key concepts include:

* Expected value of perfect information (i.e., reducing all uncertainty)
* Partial expected value of perfect information (i.e., eliminating uncertainty associated with one modeling aspect)
* Expected value of sample information (i.e., improvement from reducing uncertainty)
  - Most realistic

## Cross-walking different perspectives
Try to connect the dots across these literatures (which are largely disonnected) and consider:

::: {.incremental}
* How are decisions made now? 
* How "should" decisions be made? 
* How can decisions be made better? 
:::

# Having an identity as a decision analyst
## What roles can you play?
* Improve methods for implementing decision analysis
* Make the results of decision analysis more salient 
* Translate good decision analysis into better decision-making
* Analyze decision-making for how well it meets its objectives
* Identify currently feasible ways to improve decisions

**What roles does MORDM enable you to fill, and how completely?**

## A few closing thoughts on the course
::: {.incremental}
* MORDM operationalizes a lot of good ideas; hold onto the ideas but not necessarily the worfklow
  - RDM largely builds off of theories related to individual decision-making, not collective action problems
  - Evaluation and political science are major gaps in existing guidance on RDM framing
* Choose project and paper goals first, then find and build on the body of work that enables you to realize them
* You have a lot of decision-making experience; use your intuition to think about decision analysis and decision making for wicked social planning problems

# Logistics
## Presentations next week!
* Monday: Eric volunteered. Who else?
* Presentation peer evaluation. For each other student:
  - Write a max one-page comment with feedback on style and content
  - Style: what worked and didn't for you as an audience?
  - Content: give your best summary of their project and goals
  - Content: state your favorite part of the pitch/idea
  - Content: outline your biggest (max 3) areas of confusion

## Report stuff
* Report due Nov 26
  - The drafts were great! For the final report, I'm looking for narrower and sharper focuses for your next paper so your advisors will be glad you took this course :) 
  - I am going to randomly assign report partners so that each person has a peer evaluation aspect to their report, as well as my feedback
