# What does it mean to frame a decision analysis?

## Framing refers to how you structure a decision problem

```{dot}
digraph G{
    layout=circo
    node [style=filled,color=lightblue]; "Clarify the\ndecision context"; "Define\nobjectives"; "Develop\nalternatives";
    
    "Clarify the\ndecision context" -> "Define\nobjectives";
    "Define\nobjectives" -> "Develop\nalternatives";
}
```

## Framing informs how you analyze a decision

```{dot}
digraph G{
    layout=circo
    node [style=filled,color=orange]; "Estimate\nmetrics"; "Evaluate\ntrade-offs"; 
    "Estimate\nmetrics" -> "Evaluate\ntrade-offs";
}
```

## These are not independent! 

```{dot}
digraph G{
    layout=circo
    node [style=filled,color=lightblue]; "Clarify the\ndecision context"; "Define\nobjectives"; "Develop\nalternatives";
    node [style=filled,color=orange]; "Estimate\nmetrics"; "Evaluate\ntrade-offs"; 
    node[style=filled,color=magenta]; "Implement,\nmonitor,\nreview";
    
    "Clarify the\ndecision context" -> "Define\nobjectives";
    "Define\nobjectives" -> "Develop\nalternatives";
    "Develop\nalternatives" -> "Estimate\nmetrics";
    "Estimate\nmetrics" -> "Evaluate\ntrade-offs";
    "Evaluate\ntrade-offs" -> "Implement,\nmonitor,\nreview";
    "Implement,\nmonitor,\nreview" -> "Clarify the\ndecision context";
}
```

# Let's frame a few decision problems

## How should I travel from Hanover to Philadelphia?

## Which flight should I purchase?

## How to preserve access to clean water in the growing US Southwest? {.nostretch}

# Framing wicked climate problems is hard!

## Why is framing water management more challenging than travel recommendations?
A few hints from our examples:

* Analyzing travel options was relatively simple
* We got to the bottom of my travel goals quickly
* I have (most of) the decision-making agency and chose my favorite option

# Some good practices

## Conceptual models

## Another conceptual model

## Values-informed mental models

## Follow *some* explicit, structured process

* This is an area of decision analysis that needs more attention
* Structured decision making proponents acknowledge robust decision making (but not much), and as far as I can tell not vice versa
* You can do better than most peer-reviewed studies by doing something transparent
* It would be great to learn about good framing practices from real-world decision-making experiments
