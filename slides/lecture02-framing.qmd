# What does it mean to frame a decision analysis?

## How did you make these decisions?

::: {.incremental}
1. What did you eat for your last meal?
2. What colleges did you apply to?
3. How did you choose your PhD program?

## Framing refers to how you structure a decision problem
Framing breakfast decisions

::: {.incremental}
* I want to eat a healthy breakfast every morning that gives me energy
* It needs to be affordable, tasty, low in sugar, etc.,
* Oatmeal with peanut butter and frozen berries, toast with peanut butter and bananas, etc., 
:::


## Framing informs how you analyze a decision
Framing breakfast decisions, continued

::: {.incremental}
* I can calculate the costs, macronutrients, etc.,
* I can map out which breakfasts do better/worse on my objectives

## Framing is iterative and deliberative {.nostretch}

# Let's frame a few decision problems

## How should I travel from Hanover to Philadelphia?

## How to preserve access to clean water in the growing US Southwest? {.nostretch}

# Framing wicked climate problems is hard!

## Why is framing water management more challenging than travel recommendations?
A few hints from our examples:

* Analyzing travel options was relatively simple
* We got to the bottom of my travel goals quickly
* I have (most of) the decision-making agency and chose my favorite option
