# Uncertainty in Earth systems modeling

## What is uncertainty?

:::{.fragment}
A lack of certainty; an inability to exactly describe current or future states and values

::: {.cite} 
Parphrased from the [Wikipedia entry on Uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty)
:::

:::

## Two overarching types of uncertainty

![Yu et al. (2022). [Uncertainty quantification: Can we trust artificial intelligence in drug discovery?.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2022.104814)](../_assets/img/unc_type.jpg){fig-align=left}

**Aleatoric** uncertainty results from randomness 
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Epistemic** uncertainty results from lack of knowledge
:::

## Fundamental limits to Earth systems modeling
Earth systems are open, posing fundamental limitations on our ability to reduce all relevant areas of epistemic uncertainty. 

:::{.fragment}
::: {.quote}
> Verification and validation of numerical models of natural systems is impossible... because natural systems are never closed and because model results are always nonunique...

> Thus, the primary value of models is heuristic: Models are representations, useful for guiding further study but not susceptible to proof.

## Example: Climate scenario uncertainty is often called "deep" {.nostretch}

![Hausfather and Peters (2020). [RCP8.5 is a problematic scenario for near-term emissions](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2017124117)](../_assets/img/hausfather_scenarios_2020.jpg){width=500}

## Example: Scenario and model choices reflect "deep" uncertainty in sea-level rise projections
![Doss-Gollin and Keller (2023). [A subjective Bayesian framework for synthesizing deep uncertainties in climate risk management](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022EF003044)](../_assets/img/sea_level_deep.png)

# Neglecting uncertainty can bias decisions

## Example: Triggering managed retreat
![Hegde et al., (2025). Timing managed retreat for robust coastal adaptation strategies. In Preparation.](../_assets/img/prabhat_sys_rel.png)

## Myopic strategies
![Hegde et al., (2025). Timing managed retreat for robust coastal adaptation strategies. In Preparation.](../_assets/img/prabhat_myopia.png)

# Uncertainty characterization and sensitivity analysis

## Schematic Representation

## Many purposes - a few highlights for decision analyses

:::{.incremental}
* How can we simplify our model to run it faster and sample more scenarios?
* What are worst-case scenarios?
* Which actions perform well in a wide range of scenarios?
* What causes actions to fail?
* What types of observations should we collect to improve our model and better evaluate actions?

# Uncertainty analysis choices follow from problem framing

## Example from my research
:::{.quote}
> Because of the stated goals of the Justice40 Initiative, our main analytical goal was to evaluate different funding rules on equity and economic objectives and identify which rules perform well. To make claims about policy performance, our decision analysis was built on the following modeling chain...

:::

:::{.fragment}
One reviewer complimented us for our extensive accounting of uncertainty. However, our (narrowly scoped!) research and policy questions did not call for factor mapping or prioritization (though we call for this in our discussion). 
:::

## Some personal reflections

:::{.incremental}
* Avoid inconsistent uncertainty framing and analysis (e.g., calculating expected values when framing uncertainties as "deep")
* I feel like there's not good guidance out there on saying for decision analysis purposes, how to represent and analyze various types of uncertainty
* Don't lose sight of **why** uncertainty matters for your decision analysis (*i.e.,* don't ignore uncertainty but don't overcomplicate how you handle it)
* Remember that peer-reviewed studies are units of overall decision analysis projects (*i.e.,* don't overstuff these studies with too many analyses and points)
