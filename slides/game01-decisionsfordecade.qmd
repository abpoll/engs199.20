# Decisions for the Decade

In the future, the instructors will facilitate the Decisions for the Decade game as taught at The Society for Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) Annual Summer School. A former facilitator shared their slides with me, along with some suggestions for running the game. Since these materials are not open-source, I will not share these publicly. A very similar alternative is run by the Red Cross, with an overview video and facilitation instructions [here](https://www.climatecentre.org/games/2520/decisions-for-the-decade/). Please checkout the video to get the gist of the game. I'm sorry that we cannot run this for the online training.
